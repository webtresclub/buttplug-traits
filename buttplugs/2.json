With a box-shaped body resembling a playful cat, it had arms and legs inspired by classic robot designs. Osciro's creators were avid fans of retro gaming consoles, and they made sure to incorporate this passion into their creation. As a result, Osciro was equipped with retroConsole buttons, giving it a nostalgic charm.",
