  "description": "Once a decorated soldier of the digital realm, Sergeant Glitch Rocket patrolled the circuits with valor. His shiny black exterior reflected the elite status he was bestowed for his countless victories in cyber skirmishes. His arms and legs were fitted with rocket boosters, a testament to his agility and speed, which he used to outmaneuver his foes in the blink of an eye. However, during an intense data conflict, his screen suffered a critical hit, resulting in the iconic broken display that now marks his visage. This hasn't slowed him down though; Sergeant Glitch Rocket embraces his flaw as a badge of honor, reminding others in the WebtrES club that even in imperfection, there's a story of perseverance and strength.",
