  "description": "Blast from the past meets the future in the form of Serpent Commander Ace, the WebtrES club's own retro-futuristic hero. With a classic box head adorned by a pixelated snake screen, Ace hearkens back to the days of early gaming, while the retro console buttons on its front panel bring a touch of nostalgia. The rocket arms and legs are not just for show \u2013 they propel Ace through cyberspace at breakneck speeds, leaving a trail of digital flames. The sleek helmet addon is more than an accessory; it's a symbol of the protection Ace offers to the data realms it patrols. Born from the fusion of vintage games and modern technology, Serpent Commander Ace stands guard in the digital frontier, always ready to rocket into action at the first sign of trouble.",
