  "description": "Hailing from the cyber feline battalion of the WebtrES club, Major WhiskerBeam is known for his unyielding discipline and his high-precision laser screen that he uses to outmaneuver his opponents. With a durable soldier box for a body and swift cat-like limbs, he's an agile warrior in any digital skirmish. His uniform buttons, reminiscent of a decorated officer's attire, command respect and authority. Despite his formidable appearance, he has a soft spot for his fellow pixel-powered felines and often spends his downtime strategizing the next playful ambush. Major WhiskerBeam is a legend in the virtual arenas, with a purr as commanding as his battle tactics.",
