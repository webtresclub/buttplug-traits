  "description": "Hailing from the neon-lit alleys of the WebtrES club, Cataclysmic Purr-ogrammer is an eccentric character with a shiny yellow box body that glows like the retro arcades of yore. Known for its cat-like arms and legs, this quirky NFT is both agile and unpredictable. Legend has it that the Purr-ogrammer was once a top-tier gaming console, but after a fierce digital duel that left its screen shattered, it donned shades to hide its battle scars and adopted a mysterious persona. Despite its broken screen, it still flashes pixelated smiles to fellow WebtrES members, reminiscing the glory of its pixel-punching days. Whether it's lounging on a blocky sofa or coding up the next big thing in the WebtrES universe, Cataclysmic Purr-ogrammer is a beloved symbol of resilience and retro cool.",
