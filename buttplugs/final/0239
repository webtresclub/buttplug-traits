  "description": "Hailing from the distant galaxy of Furrion-9, Captain Whiskerblast is the most decorated soldier in the Feline Space Brigade. This fearless feline\u2019s box is made of a rare cosmic material that resembles a cat's fur, providing camouflage in interstellar dust clouds. The buttons of a soldier on his box interface are a testament to his strategic prowess, each one programmed for a different battle maneuver. With arms and legs powered by rocket thrusters, he\u2019s known for his lightning-fast reflexes and ability to navigate through asteroid fields with feline agility. The classic screen face displays a cool, calculated demeanor, only interrupted by the glow of battle. Atop his box, he wears a helmet, a relic from the historical Battle of Orion's Whiskers, where he earned his stripes. Whiskerblast is not only a hero in the WebtrES club but also a mentor to young cadets dreaming to zoom through the stars.",
