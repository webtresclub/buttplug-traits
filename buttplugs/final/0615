  "description": "Once a central piece of a bustling arcade, Sparky Pixelhammer now wanders the digital plains of WebtrES club, searching for a new purpose after a fateful encounter with a rogue gamer left his screen in a state of disrepair. With arms and legs forged from the finest pixels of the foundry level and a pair of glasses that have seen better days, Sparky reminiscences about the golden era of 8-bit adventures. Despite his broken screen, he carries an indestructible hammer from the retro realm and a resolve as strong as his pixelated physique. Sparky is a beloved character who has turned his glitch into a trademark, attracting a following of nostalgic fans and sympathetic sprites alike.",
