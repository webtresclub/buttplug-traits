  "description": "Born in the digital alleyways of WebtrES city, Catalyst Flex is an enigmatic character with a penchant for adventure and a knack for getting into trouble. His shiny yellow box exterior gleams like the city lights, and his cat-like arms and legs give him the agility to maneuver through the information superhighways with ease. The broken screen he sports is a badge of honor from a notorious scuffle with a virus gang, after which he donned his shades to hide his scars and preserve his cool demeanor. Despite his tough exterior, Catalyst's heart purrs with the warmth of a feline friend, always ready to lend a helping paw to those in need in the WebtrES club.",
