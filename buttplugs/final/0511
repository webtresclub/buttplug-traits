Known for his unbreakable spirit, even a broken screen couldn't dampen his resolve. Outfitted with resilient soldier limbs, he marched through the toughest of glitches, always cool behind his impenetrable shades. After a fateful encounter with a rogue joystick, his screen shattered, but he fashioned the scars into a symbol of his undying dedication to the game. Now, he's a legend in the WebtrES club, inspiring new bytes to be brave in the face of coding calamities.",
