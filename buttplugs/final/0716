  "description": "Hailing from the virtual barracks of WebtrES club, Captain Whiskerbyte is a valiant warrior of the pixelated plains. With a box design that stems from the noble soldier archetype, his classic buttons represent a steadfast commitment to the old-school rules of engagement. Despite his stern appearance, the cat display screen reveals his softer side, showing that he's as much a lover of peace as he is a defender of his digital comrades. His arms steadfastly hang down, always ready to lend a hand\u2014or a paw\u2014to those in need. Captain Whiskerbyte is a symbol of courage and comradery in the ever-evolving world of the WebtrES club.",
