This stoic character, known for his cat-like button interface and the sturdy foundry-crafted limbs, is a tactical genius with a love for strategy and forge. His screen displays a classic smile that belies the intricate calculations going on behind it. With an iron hammer in one hand and a spark of creation in the other, Major Whisker Forge spends his days shaping digital destinies and crafting the future of the WebtrES world.
