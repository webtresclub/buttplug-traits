  "description": "Originally a humble software interface in a gritty foundry, Catsby Forge gained self-awareness after an accidental code merge between the foundry's control system and a digital pet simulator. With a classic box design, sturdy foundry-style arms and legs built to handle molten metal, and a screen that purrs digital affection, Catsby is a unique member of the WebtrES club. The cat-shaped buttons on its console are a nod to its feline software origins, while the stylish shades add a touch of cool to its hot environment. Catsby now roams the digital and physical realms, seeking to meld the warmth of a cat's love with the strength of forged steel.",
