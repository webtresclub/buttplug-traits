Originally a lead engineer in the Meowtropolitan Rocket Division, he turned his talents to the defense sector, where his robust design and rocket arms and legs propelled him to the rank of soldier. His cat-like reflexes, paired with the sophisticated rocket propulsion system, make him an agile navigator through both cyber and stratospheric battlefields. Equipped with his trademark red and black screen, which displays tactical data and heat signatures, and his sharp glasses, he's always ready to pounce on a mission with precision and stealth. Never without his soldier buttons, Major Whiskerblast is a feline force to be reckoned with, always landing on his feet, ready to leap into the next adventure.",
