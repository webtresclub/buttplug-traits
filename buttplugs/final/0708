  "description": "Sergeant PixelShade is a veteran member of the WebtrES club, renowned for his strategic mind and unwavering courage. With his classic box-shaped body and resilient classic arms and legs, he's been through many digital battles. His screen may be broken, a testament to his combat experience, but his spirit remains unshaken. His soldier buttons are always polished, reflecting his dedication to the cause. The shades he dons are not just for style; they are a symbol of his cool demeanor in the face of adversity. Despite his stern appearance, PixelShade has a knack for inspiring fellow club members with tales of his pixelated exploits.",
