  "description": "Once the top field tactician in the pixelated video game realms, Commander Meowtari retired from virtual conflict to lead the WebtrES club's Retro Console Division. With arms often at the ready and eyes like glowing power-ups, this stoic leader hides a playful side, reminiscent of the days spent in 8-bit adventures. While his screen displays the fierceness of a warrior cat, Meowtari's true mission is to ensure the legacy of classic gaming lives on through the club's activities and gatherings. His directive now is not one of combat, but of camaraderie and the sharing of nostalgic tales from the golden era of gaming.",
