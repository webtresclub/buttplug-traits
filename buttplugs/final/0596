  "description": "Forged in the fires of the Foundry, Sergeant SerpentCraft is a battle-hardened member of the WebtrES club, known for his indestructible arms and legs capable of withstanding the harshest environments. His box, adorned with the emblem of the soldier, speaks to his unyielding spirit and tactical prowess. The buttons of his uniform, each one earned from a past victory, shine with the grit of a thousand battles. But it's his unique snake screen that sets him apart, a gift from a mystical serpent during a covert mission in the dense jungles of Pixelonia. This sentient screen grants him the ability to hypnotize his adversaries, making him a formidable ally and a terrifying foe. Whether he's wielding his trusty hammer or brandishing his sharp trident, Sergeant SerpentCraft stands as a towering figure of valor among the ranks of the WebtrES warriors.",
