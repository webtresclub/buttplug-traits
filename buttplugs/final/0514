  "description": "Born in the neon-lit arcades of the 1980s, LaserByte is a legend in the WebtrES club. With a retro console for a body and a screen that can project laser visuals, LaserByte is the life of every digital party. His classic button configuration is a hit with old-school gamers, and his moves are as smooth as the joystick maneuvers he was famous for. Whether busting out pixelated dance moves or hosting gaming marathons, LaserByte is a blast from the past who knows how to light up the future.",
