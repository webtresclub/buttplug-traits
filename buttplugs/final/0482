  "description": "Once a mainframe computer controlling the foundry's critical operations, Forge Helm Sparky was known for his steadfast reliability and classic button interface. After an unfortunate accident involving a stray bolt of lightning, Sparky's screen shattered, irreparably distorting his digital visage. Refusing to be decommissioned, he donned a sturdy helmet salvaged from the factory floor, repurposed his arms and legs from the assembly line's strongest alloys, and vowed to continue his duties. Now, as a beloved member of the WebtrES club, he channels his workman's spirit into every task, his screen's spiderweb cracks a badge of resilience in the face of adversity.",
