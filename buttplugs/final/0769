  "description": "Once a high-flying member of the WebtrES club, Feline Flyer 404 was known for acing every mission with his rocket arms and legs that could take him to the stratosphere. His shiny black box frame, reflecting the sun's rays, made him a striking figure against the canvas of the sky. Feline Flyer 404 was not just about speed and looks, his cat buttons were programmable to purr-fectly handle any situation, making him the most adaptable robot of the fleet. However, during a risky expedition into the Cyberstorm Nebula, a stray piece of space debris left his screen with a spiderweb crack, symbolizing his one and only failed mission. Although this ended his streak, it didn't diminish his spirit. The broken screen now serves as a reminder to himself and others that even the mightiest can face setbacks, but it's the courage to continue that truly counts.",
