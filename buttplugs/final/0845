  "description": "Once a valiant pixel warrior on the digital battlefields, Sergeant Forge now spends his days at the WebtrES club, recounting tales of his legendary exploits. His shiny black exterior still gleams with the polish of countless campaigns, though now adorned with the scars of battle - a cracked screen stands as a testament to his last epic encounter. Equipped with arms and legs forged from the strongest virtual metal, he wields a hammer as a symbol of his indomitable will to repair what's broken - in both code and spirit. Although his soldier's buttons no longer command an army, they serve as a reminder of his unwavering discipline and strength. Sergeant Forge's story is one of resilience and determination, inspiring all in the WebtrES club with the valor of an old-school fighter in a new age of pixels and bytes.",
