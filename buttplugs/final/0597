  "description": "Born in the virtual alleys of WebtrES City, Slyther Bot is a unique blend of street-smart and tech-savvy. With a classic box chassis that harks back to the early days of robotic design, Slyther is a charming anachronism in the hyper-modern world. The buttons bearing cat motifs are a nod to Slyther's playful side, responding with a soft purr to the right kind of digital stroke. Its arms are always hand-down, ready to pick up on the latest tech trends or throw down in a dance-off. The crowning glory is the helmet, a relic from the legendary Cyber Jousts of '25, where Slyther made history by outmaneuvering the reigning champions with its serpentine screen savviness. Now, taking a break from the competitive scene, Slyther Bot roams the grid, sharing tales of pixelated valor and byte-sized camaraderie.",
