  "description": "SlytherPixel hails from the buzzing neon-lit arcades of the digital metropolis of WebtrES. With a sleek, shiny black exterior and a screen that perpetually plays the classic 'Snake' game, SlytherPixel is a nostalgic nod to the past. This character boasts a pair of hand-down arms that are always ready for action and legs that stride with pixelated purpose. The retro console buttons on its front are not just for show; they hold the secret codes to the hidden levels of the WebtrES club's virtual realm. SlytherPixel loves nothing more than to guide club members through the labyrinth of old-school gaming, sharing tales of pixelated adventures and high scores that are the stuff of legends.",
