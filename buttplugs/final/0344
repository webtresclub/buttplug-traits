  "description": "Once the fastest data processor in all of WebtrES club, JetBoost Crashbyte was known for his blazing calculation speeds and his ability to soar through the information superhighway with his rocket arms and legs. Legend has it that he attempted to parse the entire internet in under a nanosecond, which caused his screen to crack, symbolizing his overly ambitious attempt. Although his screen is now broken, leaving a spider-web pattern that occasionally flickers with sparks of his former computing power, he's still a sought-after member for any digital task force, ready to rocket into action with a burst of energy and a can-do attitude. His classic box and buttons remind others of the golden era of computing, while his daring spirit keeps him at the forefront of any cyber adventure.",
