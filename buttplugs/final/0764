  "description": "Once the pinnacle of high-tech infantry, Sergeant PixelCrack was known for his impeccable strategy in digital warfare games. His shiny black exterior was feared in the pixelated battlefields where he commanded his troops with precision and authority. However, during the infamous Glitch War, a stray line of corrupt code shattered his screen, leaving a spider-web crack as a mark of his sacrifice. Despite his broken screen and the chaos of fragmented graphics that now define his appearance, his soldier buttons remain intact, symbolizing his undying commitment to the WebtrES club. As a member of this elite group, he now serves as a mentor to the new generation of digital warriors, teaching them the art of resilience in the virtual world.",
