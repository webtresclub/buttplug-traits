  "description": "Hailing from the gritty pixelated backstreets of Gamerville, Sergeant Whiskerbyte is a veteran of many console wars. With a classic box chassis equipped with a retro console interface, he commands respect from every corner of the digital realm. His arms and legs are reinforced with soldier-grade pixel armor, allowing him to navigate through the toughest code skirmishes. The cat screen face is a tribute to his nine lives spent debugging the most challenging software operations. Topping off his battle-hardened appearance is a sturdy helmet, symbolizing his readiness for any virtual combat. Despite his tough exterior, Sergeant Whiskerbyte's heart hums to the nostalgic tunes of 8-bit anthems, and he's always ready to lend a helping hand or claw to a fellow WebtrES club member in need.",
