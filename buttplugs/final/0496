  "description": "Sergeant Forge is the epitome of resilience among the WebtrES club. Forged in the foundry of digital conflict, his arms and legs are as sturdy as the hardest alloys. Donning his signature soldier box, armed with unyielding soldier buttons, he has seen many battles, a fact attested to by his broken screen, which he wears as a badge of honor. His military-grade helmet addon is a symbol of his leadership and unwavering courage in the face of chaos. Despite the cracks and scars, Sergeant Forge stands tall, a beacon of strength and determination in the ever-evolving landscape of the WebtrES club.",
