  "description": "Hailing from the neon-soaked alleyways of Pixel City, RetroRacer Zoom is a legend in the underground retro gaming circuits. Clad in a chassis of the most vibrant rosso corsa, he's a charming rogue with an insatiable need for speed. With arms and legs modified for rocket-powered maneuvers, he's as swift on his feet as he is quick-witted. The retro console buttons on his front panel are a tribute to the classic games he has mastered over the years, and his screen always displays an ever-moving snake, paying homage to the iconic game that started it all for him. His eyewear isn't just for show; those glasses are state-of-the-art tech, allowing him to analyze and simulate game strategies in microseconds. A member of the prestigious WebtrES club, RetroRacer Zoom is always ready to blast off to his next gaming adventure or to outmaneuver opponents in a virtual showdown.",
