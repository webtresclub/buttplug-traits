  "description": "Hailing from the neon-lit streets of Digitropolis, Cattivo Velocista is a legend in the underground racing circuits of the WebtrES club. With a box painted in the iconic rossoCorsa, this racer's presence on the track is as bold and fiery as the color itself. The cat-themed buttons that adorn its chassis are a nod to its nine-lives reputation, always landing on its feet no matter how harrowing the race. Its arms are perpetually poised handDown, ready to shift gears at a moment's notice, while its screen displays a fierce red and black color scheme, mirroring the racer's intensity. The helmet, a rare addon, is not just for style \u2013 it's a trophy from the grand Pixel Prix, where Cattivo Velocista left the competition in a cloud of pixels. This NFT is more than digital art; it's the embodiment of speed, agility, and the relentless spirit of competition.",
