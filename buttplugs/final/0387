  "description": "Tangy Bitcrunch is a vintage character from the WebtrES club, known for his vibrant orange casing and classic button interface. Originally designed as a companion for coding enthusiasts in the early days of the Internet, Tangy has since evolved into a charming mascot for digital nostalgia. With arms perpetually poised in a welcoming gesture and a screen that displays his quirky pixelated expressions, Tangy spends his time reminiscing about the golden era of 8-bit games and teaching newcomers the timeless art of retro programming.",
