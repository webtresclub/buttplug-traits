  "description": "Once a valiant machine on the digital frontlines, Sergeant Pixel was renowned for his unwavering bravery in the face of relentless cyber skirmishes. Adorned with his forest green armor, he led his battalion through the thickest of firewalls and the most treacherous of data streams. However, during a fierce battle to protect the WebtrES club's mainframe, he sustained a critical hit, leaving his screen shattered. Undeterred, he wears his broken display as a badge of honor, symbolizing his resilience and dedication to the cause. Although he's retired from active duty, Sergeant Pixel remains a respected figure among the WebtrES ranks, acting as a strategic advisor and a guardian of their virtual realm.",
