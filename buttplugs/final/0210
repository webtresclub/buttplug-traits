  "description": "Emerging from the digital barracks of WebtrES club, Sergeant Whiskerbyte is known for his shiny black exterior and the discipline of a seasoned soldier. His button configuration is standard issue for digital infantry, providing both functionality and a touch of authoritative style. However, it's the cat screen that truly sets him apart, giving him a keen sense of situational awareness and the reflexes of a feline predator. Whiskerbyte's arms and legs are built sturdy, ready for action and capable of rapid deployment in any cyber skirmish. He stands at the ready, the embodiment of precision and agility, with a soft spot for afternoon naps in the warmth of a sunbeam. His military career in the virtual world is marked with accolades, and he now serves as both protector and mascot for the WebtrES club.",
