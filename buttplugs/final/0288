  "description": "Born in the pixelated depths of an old-school arcade, Commander Pixel is a legend in the WebtrES club. Donning his iconic shades, he's known for his strategic mind and no-nonsense attitude. His classic screen has seen more battles than most, displaying an impressive array of victories and high scores. As a retro console with a soldier's arms and legs, he stands firm in the face of any digital challenge. His hand on the joystick is always steady, and his button-mashing skills are second to none. Commanding respect and nostalgia, Commander Pixel is a true warrior of the 8-bit era, always ready to lead his fellow club members to virtual glory.",
