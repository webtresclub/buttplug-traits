  "description": "Major Whiskerbyte is a high-ranking officer in the feline defense forces of the WebtrES club. With a shiny black exterior that reflects his impeccable discipline, and soldier button insignias that demonstrate his decorated military career, he commands respect and attention wherever he goes. His arms and legs, though feline in appearance, are engineered for agility and strength, aiding him in both tactical maneuvers and the occasional need to climb the heights of cybernetic trees. His screen face, adorned with cat-like eyes, is usually set in a serious expression, but those who know him well can occasionally catch a glimpse of a warm pixelated purr when he's pleased. His tail, though not visible in his official portrait, is rumored to be a state-of-the-art communication antenna, keeping him in constant contact with his digital troops. Major Whiskerbyte's storied career has made him a legend in the WebtrES community, and his strategic prowess is often sought after by other digital entities looking to enhance their security protocols.",
