  "description": "Born in the heart of a pixelated universe, ForgePlay V1 comes from a long line of arcade-inspired robots. With its classic boxy appearance and a screen that perpetually plays 'Snake', this quirky character is a nod to the golden era of gaming. Sporting retro console buttons that hark back to a simpler time when gameplay was king, ForgePlay V1 has arms and legs forged from the finest virtual metals, indicative of its foundry roots. Always seen with a hammer and wrench, it's known for its ability to fix broken game code and bring back to life the cherished games of the past. ForgePlay V1 is a favorite among the WebtrES club, where it serves as a bridge between the rich history of video games and the modern era of playable NFTs.",
