  "description": "SerpentByte is a quirky member of the WebtrES club, known for his love of puzzles and all things serpentine. With an orange box for a body and a screen that perpetually displays a snake game, SerpentByte is a hit at any digital party. His classic button configuration is reminiscent of the golden age of arcade games, and his hands are always positioned down as if ready to challenge a newcomer to a game of snake. Despite his pixelated appearance, SerpentByte is a master of strategy and often surprises his peers with his quick thinking and problem-solving skills. In the virtual world of WebtrES, he's the go-to guy when you're in a digital bind and need a clever way out.",
