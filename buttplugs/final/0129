  "description": "Hailing from the retro-futuristic landscapes of the WebtrES club, Sergeant PixelBlast is a valiant warrior encased in a box reminiscent of old-school gaming consoles. With buttons designed for a soldier and arms and legs to match, he maneuvers through both the digital and physical realms with ease. His screen, equipped with laser vision, gives him the power to scan the horizon for both friends and foes. Once a guardian of the forgotten arcade cabinets, he now pledges his allegiance to the gamers and netizens of WebtrES, ever ready to defend the pixelated frontiers of cyberspace.",
