  "description": "Hailing from the pixelated planet of Meowter Space, Captain Whiskerblast is a valiant member of the WebtrES club, known for his daring space expeditions. With an orange chassis that can withstand the heat of re-entry, soldier-style buttons ready for tactical commands, and rocket arms and legs that propel him through the cosmos, he's always up for action. His screen displays the stoic face of his feline inspiration, a cat known across the galaxy for its wisdom and nine lives. Topped with a helmet for interstellar protection, Captain Whiskerblast is a hero among his pixel peers, embarking on missions that push the boundaries of exploration and adventure.",
