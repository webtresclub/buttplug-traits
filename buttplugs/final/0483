With arms and legs of the classic make, Serpentron is agile and poised, moving with the precision of a soldier\u2014each limb equipped with buttons that can deploy a variety of virtual tools. The most striking feature, however, is the snake screen, a hypnotic display that scrolls cryptic runes and patterns, mesmerizing all who dare to peer into its depths.
