  "description": "Hailing from the pixelated plains of the WebtrES club, CatButton Coder is known for its classic box design and iconic cat button interface. This digital denizen spends its days crafting code and charming fellow club members with its retro screen face, often lighting up with the nostalgic green hues of a bygone computing era. Its arms are always ready for action, positioned handDown, signifying a no-nonsense approach to problem-solving and a readiness to leap into action. Despite its serious work ethic, CatButton Coder has a playful side, inviting interaction with a soft 'meow' whenever its cat buttons are pressed. A beloved figure in the WebtrES community, CatButton Coder is a beacon of old-school cool in a modern digital world.",
