  "description": "Hailing from the digital frontiers of the WebtrES club, Sergeant Whiskerbyte is a valiant defender of cyber felines. With his sturdy orange armor displaying the heroism of the soldier class, this pixelated guardian has the unique trait of cat-like extremities, granting him agility and balance unmatched by his peers. His face, a classic screen, often displays the battle-ready scowl encoded into his very pixels. Whiskerbyte spends his downtime hacking into yarn ball simulators and sharpening his reflexes with laser pointer chase programs. His mission: to maintain the peace and purr-ogramming integrity of the WebtrES universe.",
