  "description": "Forged in the digital battlefields of the WebtrES club, Sgt. SerpentScreen is a tactical enigma wrapped in pixelated armor. With a box as shiny and black as the darkest night, this formidable character stands out for their snake-inspired screen, ever observant and ready to strike with information. Donning a helmet for protection against virtual hazards, Sgt. SerpentScreen serves as the sentinel of cyberspace, their soldier-like arms and legs always at the ready. The buttons they sport are not just for show; they represent the discipline and control of a soldier, honed through countless skirmishes in the digital realm. Sgt. SerpentScreen is the guardian of secrets, the shield against virtual threats, and a loyal ally in the ever-evolving world of the WebtrES club.",
