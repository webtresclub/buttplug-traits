  "description": "Hailing from the digital depths of an 80s arcade machine, Pixel Serpent Spectacles is a retro-console inspired NFT with a passion for classic gaming and a knack for coding slithery software. With its shiny yellow casing and iconic round glasses, it stands out in the WebtrES club as the go-to bot for nostalgic game nights and hacking marathons. While it might have its hand down, ready to relax, don't be fooled; this bot's mind is always racing through the next level of its snake game. Its fellow club members rely on Pixel's encyclopedic knowledge of gaming history and quick-witted tech support.",
