  "description": "Catalyst 9-Lives is a rare entity from the infamous WebtrES club, known for its shiny yellow box that gleams like a beacon of curiosity in the digital realm. Adorned with cat-themed buttons that are as whimsical as they are mysterious, Catalyst is a blend of retro and feline charm. The classic arms and legs give Catalyst a timeless appeal, while the classic screen face flashes expressions in old-school pixel art. Never running out of energy or enthusiasm, Catalyst 9-Lives is said to have evolved from the code of an ancient arcade game, gaining sentience and a love for digital adventure. With each reboot, Catalyst claims to gain another 'life,' embodying the spirit of resilience and joy in the virtual world of WebtrES.",
