  "description": "Sergeant Pixel is the embodiment of digital valor, born from the retro gaming era and hardened by pixelated battles. Equipped with a console interface and donned in a camouflaged helmet, this member of the WebtrES club is known for strategizing in the most complex of virtual environments. His screen displays a snake, a throwback to one of the first and most iconic mobile games, symbolizing his ability to adapt and survive in any situation. With limbs trained in digital warfare and a steadfast resolve, Sergeant Pixel is always ready for the next challenge, be it in the realm of bits and bytes or the sprawling WebtrES universe.",
