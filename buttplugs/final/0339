  "description": "Nestled within the digital forests of the WebtrES club, Cattus Screeno is a unique blend of feline agility and technological prowess. With a forest green box body that allows him to blend seamlessly into the virtual woodlands, and button controls that mimic the soft pads of a cat's paws, he's as enigmatic as he is adorable. His red and black screen displays expressions as varied as the moods of the wildest domestic felines, while his cat-like limbs grant him the grace and stealth of a nocturnal hunter. Don't be fooled by his striped battery tail; it holds enough energy to fuel his curious adventures and clever antics. He's a beloved figure in the WebtrES community, known for his playful pranks and the soft, comforting purrs that emanate from his speakers, providing a sense of companionship to every member of the club.",
