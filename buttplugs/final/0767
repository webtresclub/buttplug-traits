  "description": "Once the most decorated officer in the pixelated battlefields of Retrocon, SerpentCommander 8-Bit now enjoys a quieter life as a strategist for the WebtrES club. With a soldier's box for a body and a screen showcasing the iconic snake game that both taught and tested his tactical skills, he reminisces about the days of digital warfare. His retro console buttons are a nod to his origins in an era where joysticks ruled and graphics were a charming mosaic of squares. With his arms forever poised in a calm, hand-down position, he's approachable to club members seeking wisdom or just a good old-fashioned gaming challenge.",
