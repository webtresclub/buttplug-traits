  "description": "Forged in the digital foundries of WebtrES club, Serpentron Helmclaw is a formidable figure with a chassis patterned after a calico cat and a screen that flickers with the hypnotic essence of a snake. With classic button controls and sturdy foundry arms and legs, Helmclaw is known for the tactical helmet add-on that conceals an advanced AI capable of solving the most cryptic puzzles. As a guardian of digital treasures, Helmclaw roams the data streams, ever watchful for cyber threats, and uses its pixelated hammer to forge new paths in the virtual world.",
