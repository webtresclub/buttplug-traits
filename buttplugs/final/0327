  "description": "Hailing from the neon-lit alleyways of Meowtropolis, Catalyst Prime is a shiny yellow box-shaped NFT with the heart of a feline and the body of cutting-edge technology. Known for its purr-programmed buttons and sleek cat-like limbs, this digital denizen spends its nights coding and its days basking in the glow of computer screens. With a screen face that displays an ever-changing array of cat expressions, Catalyst Prime is both a mystery and a marvel in the WebtrES club, admired for its quirky charm and its uncanny ability to always land on its feet in the ever-fluctuating NFT market.",
