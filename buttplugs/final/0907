  "description": "Hailing from the digital barracks of WebtrES club, Sergeant ShadeByte is a formidable figure with a shiny yellow chassis that gleams like the midday sun. His classic button configuration is reminiscent of a bygone era, and his arms and legs are built to military specifications, hinting at his background as a disciplined digital soldier. The classic screen face, often seen expressing cool determination, is perpetually hidden behind a pair of sleek, dark shades. These aren't just for style; they're equipped with advanced optic sensors that allow him to analyze his surroundings at a glance. Despite his tough exterior, ShadeByte has a soft spot for nostalgic video games and spends his downtime mastering every arcade classic in the virtual realm.",
