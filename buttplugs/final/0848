  "description": "PixelPlay Greg hails from a realm where retro is forever in vogue. Born from the golden era of arcade cabinets and home consoles, Greg is the unofficial historian of the WebtrES club. With his classic screen always displaying the iconic Space Invaders game and retro console body complete with nostalgic buttons, Greg is a walking tribute to the dawn of video gaming. His hands are perpetually poised to challenge any passerby to a game, with a thumb ready to mash buttons and a smile that invites friendly competition. While he seems content living in the past, don't let his old-school exterior fool you; Greg has a knack for predicting the next big trends in gaming and often surprises his friends with his insightful industry predictions.",
