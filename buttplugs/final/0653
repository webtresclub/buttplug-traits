  "description": "Sergeant Pixel is a distinguished member of the WebtrES club, known for his unwavering discipline and a screen that's as sharp as his tactical skills. Born in the digital realm of the early arcade era, he quickly rose through the ranks with his soldier buttons always polished and ready for action. His classic box frame houses a heart of pure vintage, while his red and black screen reflects the intensity of his old-school gaming spirit. Off duty, Sergeant Pixel mentors the next generation of pixels, instilling in them the valor and code of the classic games from which he was forged.",
