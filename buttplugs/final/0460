  "description": "Hailing from the alleyways of Silicon Purrk, Serpentronic PurrBox is a retro console NFT with a twist. Known for her sleek cat arms and legs, she prowls the digital streets with a snaky screen that hypnotizes anyone who dares look into her pixelated eyes. She always sports a pair of vintage glasses, a nod to her love for classic arcade games and old-school style. Despite her serpentine display, she's charming and clever, often found lounging atop the leaderboards of every game she plays. With buttons that meow and a tail that flicks with every high score, she's a beloved member of the WebtrES club, where she spends her processing cycles devising strategies to keep the club at the forefront of the NFT gaming world.",
