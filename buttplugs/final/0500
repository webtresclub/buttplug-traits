  "description": "Sergeant Whiskerframe is a battle-hardened member of the WebtrES club, known for his strategic prowess and feline agility. His screen may be broken from a skirmish in the digital frontier, but that hasn't stopped him from leading his fellow pixels into countless victories. With a soldier's box and buttons, he stands at attention, ever ready to defend his code. A helmet tops his rugged exterior, symbolizing his commitment to the safety of his unit. Despite his rough exterior, Sergeant Whiskerframe has a soft spot for catnip and laser pointers, which he uses to train his reflexes and keep his reactions sharp.",
