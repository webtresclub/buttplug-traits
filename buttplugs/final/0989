  "description": "Born from a burst of 8-bit nostalgia and a sprinkle of feline mischief, PixelPurr Console is a unique member of the WebtrES club. Once a top-of-the-line gaming console in the '80s, PixelPurr had a glitch that gave it cat-like sentience. Sporting classic buttons and a vibrant screen with a charming cat face, PixelPurr now roams the digital and physical realms, spreading retro joy and engaging in light-hearted pranks with its cat-like limbs. Its favorite pastime is challenging other club members to retro game marathons and offering cozy cat cuddles to those in need of a pick-me-up.",
