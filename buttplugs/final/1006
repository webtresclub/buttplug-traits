  "description": "Forged in the fires of the WebtrES club's most advanced foundries, Catalyst Forge is the epitome of precision and craftsmanship. With a classic box design that harks back to the golden age of robotic innovation, this bot stands out with its unique cat-themed buttons that offer a playful contrast to its industrial might. Its arms and legs, products of the strongest foundries, are capable of withstanding extreme conditions, making it a favorite amongst space explorers and intergalactic blacksmiths. The laser screen face of Catalyst Forge is not just for show; it's a high-energy projection surface capable of cutting through the thickest of asteroid ores. Despite its intimidating appearance and capabilities, Catalyst Forge has a soft spot for felines and can often be found creating intricate cat sculptures out of scrap metal.",
