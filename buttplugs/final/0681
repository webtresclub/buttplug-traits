  "description": "Major WhiskerByte is a distinguished member of the WebtrES club, known for his steadfast loyalty and strategic mind. Fashioned from the 'soldier' line, he stands tall with his 'handDown' arms and legs, always at the ready. His box displays the stoic composure of a soldier, reinforced by matching 'soldier' buttons that signify his rank and role. However, it's the 'cat' screen that truly sets him apart, showcasing his keen instincts and sharp reflexes, traits that have served him well in countless digital skirmishes. Behind that feline fa\u00e7ade lies the heart of a warrior, ever vigilant in the defense of the WebtrES community.",
