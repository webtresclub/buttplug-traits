  "description": "Once a beacon of retro entertainment, Pixel Breaker thrived in the golden era of arcade games. With a shiny black exterior and classic button configuration, it was the go-to machine for gamers seeking the thrill of pixelated adventures. Unfortunately, a fateful encounter with an overzealous player left its screen with a spiderweb of cracks, symbolizing its battle scars in the digital realm. Undeterred by its broken screen, Pixel Breaker has become a symbol of resilience in the WebtrES club, reminding members that even when out of order, the spirit of gaming lives on.",
