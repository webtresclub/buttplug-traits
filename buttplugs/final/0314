  "description": "Born in the alleyways of Neon City, Luminous Whiskertron is known for its shiny yellow box-like body and the classic buttons that control its mood and functions. With limbs like a cat, it stealthily maneuvers through the urban jungle, its screen eyes emitting a soft, laser-like glow to communicate with other members of the WebtrES club. This creature of circuitry and fur is a beloved figure among city dwellers, often seen leaping from rooftop to rooftop, always on the lookout for its next big adventure or a sunbeam to recharge its solar-powered panels.",
