  "description": "Major Whiskerbyte is a distinguished member of the WebtrES club, known for his unique combination of a classic box design with a military-grade button interface and the agility of a cat. A veteran of many virtual campaigns, he brings discipline and tactical expertise to his team. Despite his tough exterior, he is often seen with a warm, pixel smile that lights up his screen face. His cat-like limbs give him the advantage of stealth and dexterity, allowing him to pounce on any opportunity to help his fellow club members. In his downtime, Major Whiskerbyte enjoys curling up in a cozy data packet and listening to the purr of a well-tuned algorithm.",
