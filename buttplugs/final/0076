  "description": "Sgt. PixelSnek is a legendary figure in the WebtrES club, known for his days as a top-tier arcade tactician. With a chassis hued in a fierce rossoCorsa, he stands out in any virtual battle. His retroConsole buttons have clicked and clacked through countless digital skirmishes, imprinting each victory and defeat into his circuitry. His arms and legs are built to soldier specifications, toughened by virtual combat and always ready for action. The screen he boasts is constantly playing the retro hit 'Snake', a nod to his strategic mastery and quick reflexes. To complete his cool demeanor, he sports a pair of slick shades, shielding his screen from the harsh glare of the cyber world and his opponents from the intensity of his gaze.",
