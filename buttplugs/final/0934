  "description": "Born in a digital realm where cat memes reign supreme, Catastrophe Clyde was once the purr-fect example of feline-themed entertainment. But after a notorious incident involving a cyber yarn-ball and a virtual scratch post, his screen cracked, and he's been a bit on edge ever since. With his orange casing and a helmet that's seen better days, Clyde roams the WebtrES club, seeking to repair his screen and regain his pixel-perfect charm. His buttons may resemble a cat's whimsical grace, but don't let that fool you \u2013 beneath that broken exterior lies a heart of pure 8-bit gold, always ready to lend a hand (or paw) to anyone in need.",
