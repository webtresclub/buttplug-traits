  "description": "A remnant from the golden age of arcade games, SerpentByte basks in nostalgia. His entire existence is dedicated to keeping the classic snake game alive. You'll often find him weaving through the digital landscapes of the WebtrES club, challenging members to beat their high scores. With his shiny yellow exterior and hand-down arms, SerpentByte is a beacon of retro gaming in a modern world. His classic red, yellow, blue, and white buttons are not just for show; they are fully functional and provide an authentic gaming experience. Despite his old-school looks, SerpentByte is quite the social creature in the club, using his charm and quick wits to slither his way into the hearts of other members. Beware, though; he's been known to cause a bit of mischief now and then, leaving pixelated apple cores in the wake of his endless appetite for high scores.",
