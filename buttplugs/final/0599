  "description": "Commander PixelShade, a valiant member of the WebtrES club, is known for his iconic orange boxy frame, which has seen many virtual battles. With a screen that displays the classic arcade era and buttons that have clicked and clacked through countless strategic maneuvers, he stands as a testament to the old-school gaming legends. His soldier-like arms and legs are a nod to his commitment to maintaining digital order, while his shades reflect a cool, unflappable nature, even in the face of the most chaotic cyber skirmishes. Legend has it that Commander PixelShade was once a top-secret arcade game character who gained sentience and now roams the digital realm, looking for allies in the quest to keep the world of WebtrES both fun and secure.",
