  "description": "Hailing from the retro digital forests of the WebtrES club, Commander Pixel is a legendary figure with a green boxy exterior reminiscent of ancient gaming consoles. Equipped with retro console buttons that have seen countless battles, his arms and legs are built like those of a durable soldier, ready to take on any mission. But it's not just his sturdy build that makes him stand out; Commander Pixel's screen displays a menacing laser visage, a warning to any who dare challenge him. Despite his formidable appearance, Commander Pixel has a heart of gold, and is a protector of the pixelated realm, always at the ready to defend his fellow club members from digital distress.",
