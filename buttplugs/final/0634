  "description": "Hailing from the heart of the Silicon Forest, PixelPreston is a vintage bot with a passion for retro gaming and a knack for old-school code. He sports an iconic forest green box with a classic screen that flickers like an '80s arcade game. His buttons are reminiscent of a console controller from the era, evoking a sense of nostalgia every time they click. With arms and legs of the simplest design, he moves with the charming awkwardness of a character from an early platformer. The glasses PixelPreston wears aren't just for show\u2014they're his window into the digital world, projecting lines of code and pixelated adventures. As a member of the prestigious WebtrES club, he's known for throwing the most talked-about LAN parties where he can be found discussing the golden age of gaming or debugging with an enthusiasm that could reboot a corrupted hard drive.",
