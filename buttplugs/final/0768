  "description": "SlytherScreen hails from the pixelated plains of the retro gaming universe, a place where classic arcade games reign supreme. With a body that resembles the iconic hardware of yesteryears, SlytherScreen's screen perpetually plays the legendary game of Snake, a testament to its love for the simple yet challenging digital pastimes. Its classic buttons and arms and legs are a nod to the enduring design of early gaming consoles. SlytherScreen spends its bytes charming other members of the WebtrES club with its nostalgic flair and timeless gameplay wisdom.",
