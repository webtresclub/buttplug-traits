  "description": "Forged in the depths of a clandestine virtual armory, Serpentron is the epitome of stealth and strategy. Their shiny black exterior is composed of a rare digital alloy, highly sought after for its ability to absorb light and cloak its wearer in shadows. The classic buttons that adorn their front panel are a nod to the retro origins from which they were inspired, each one capable of deploying a different tactical program. Serpentron's arms and legs are reinforced with a soldier's durability, able to withstand the harshest of cyber battlegrounds. What truly sets them apart is the snake screen, a cunning AI interface with a mind as quick and elusive as the reptile itself, always ready to strike with precision in the high-stakes world of the WebtrES club.",
