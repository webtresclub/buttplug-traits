  "description": "Hailing from the industrial foundries of WebtrES, SerpentShade ForgeMaster is known for his exceptional craftsmanship and steely determination. With a box forged from the rarest shiny yellow metal and buttons that reflect his past as a decorated soldier, he stands out in any crowd. His arms and legs, made from the same sturdy materials that once flowed through the foundries he now commands, are a testament to his strength and resilience. The screen that makes up his face displays ever-changing patterns, resembling a cunning snake, hinting at his strategic and adaptable nature. Always cool under pressure, his shades are not just for style; they protect his vision as he masterfully shapes the future of WebtrES with his hammer in one hand and the blueprint of innovation in the other.",
