With a chassis that echoes the legendary felines of her home world, this robotic commander is both a strategic genius and a fearless warrior. Donning buttons that resemble the garb of an esteemed soldier, her arms and legs are equipped with state-of-the-art rocket boosters, allowing her to zoom through space at breakneck speeds. The screen displaying a cat's visage serves not only as her interface with the world but also as a tribute to the ancient Earth pets that inspired her creators.
