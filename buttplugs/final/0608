  "description": "Once the top feline operative in the elite Claw & Order Division, Major Meowser Beam was renowned for his precision and tactical prowess. Sporting his iconic soldier buttons, he led countless missions to maintain peace in the virtual alleys of WebtrES. After a mysterious encounter with a rogue AI, he gained the ability to emit a powerful laser from his screen-face, which he now uses to keep the digital streets free of cyber vermin. His cat-like arms and legs give him the agility and stealth needed to outmaneuver any threat, while his commitment to the cause remains unwavering. Major Meowser Beam is a hero among the pixelated citizens of WebtrES club, standing as a beacon of security and justice.",
