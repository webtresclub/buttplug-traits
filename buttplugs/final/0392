  "description": "SerpentoByte is a unique member of the WebtrES club, known for its striking green screen and a mysterious snake-like cursor that slithers across its display. This digital feline entity sports classic button controls, a nod to the retro arcade machines of the past. Its arms are always poised hand-down, ready to code or engage in digital shenanigans. The cat ears atop its monitor hint at its playful and curious nature, while the snake cursor reveals a cunning and slightly unpredictable side. SerpentoByte spends its time weaving through the vast cyberspace, crafting intricate programs, and leaving a trail of pixelated puzzles for others to solve.",
