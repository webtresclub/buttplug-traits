  "description": "Once a valiant console of the pixelated battlefields, Sergeant WhiskerFrame served in the legendary 8-bit wars, where sprites clashed and high scores were the medals of honor. With a screen cracked in a fateful encounter that saved his platoon of arcade avatars, he now dons a helmet as a symbol of his undying commitment to the game. Sporting cat-like limbs, he is nimble and quick, able to land on his feet no matter the challenge. His retro console buttons, worn from years of button mashing, still carry the muscle memory of a thousand virtual victories. Today, as a member of the elite WebtrES club, he strategizes digital missions, ever ready to jump back into action and lead a new generation of gamers to glory.",
