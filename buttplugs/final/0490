  "description": "Hailing from the digital frontlines of the WebtrES club, Sergeant PixelBrick is a battle-hardened warrior known for his unwavering courage. His screen may be cracked from a skirmish in the cyber trenches, but his spirit remains unbroken. Adorned with a rugged camo helmet, Sergeant PixelBrick has classic control buttons that have seen countless presses in the heat of virtual battles. Despite his hands perpetually fixed in a calm downward position, he\u2019s always ready to leap into action. Each pixel on his screen tells a story of valor, and even with a fragmented display, his resolve to protect the digital realm and its inhabitants is crystal clear.",
