  "description": "Hailing from the distant galaxy of Furrion V, Major WhiskerBoost is a renowned member of the WebtrES club known for his shiny black box-like body that can withstand the harshest cosmic storms. His soldier buttons, always polished and ready for action, reflect his military background and dedication to the protection of his fellow club members. Equipped with rocket arms and legs, he can zoom through space at unbelievable speeds, leaving a trail of stardust in his wake. The cat screen he proudly displays is actually a highly advanced AI interface endowed with the sass and wisdom of a thousand feline creatures, making him both a strategic genius and a charming companion. Resting atop his square frame is a battle-worn helmet, a token from his legendary skirmish against the rogue asteroids of the Kibblebelt. Major WhiskerBoost is not just a hero; he's a symbol of courage and curiosity, ever ready to pounce on the next adventure.",
