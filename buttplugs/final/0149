  "description": "A seasoned veteran of the digital front, Major Velocity was once a high-ranking officer in the Pixelated Brigade. With a soldier's box, classic button controls, and high-powered laser screen, he's a tactical mastermind on the battlefield. After a fateful encounter with the renegade code sorcerer, Hexadecimal, Velocity was granted rocket arms and legs, enhancing his agility and speed to superhuman levels. Now a prominent member of the WebtrES club, he leads his squad on perilous missions to safeguard the cyber-realm. Off-duty, Major Velocity enjoys strategizing speed runs for classic video games, reminiscing about the golden era of 8-bit glory.",
