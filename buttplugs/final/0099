  "description": "Retro Rex is a quirky member of the WebtrES club, known for his passion for vintage video games and his classic boxy appearance reminiscent of old-school consoles. With his retroConsole buttons and handDown arms, he's always ready to challenge anyone to a throwback gaming marathon. The redBlack screen displays his intense focus and competitive spirit, while his helmet, a rare addon, signifies his readiness for any virtual battle. Rex is a legend in the WebtrES community, often found reminiscing about the glory days of 8-bit adventures and pixelated platformers.",
