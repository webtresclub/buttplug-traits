With his classic button interface, he commands his digital troops with precision and ease. His sturdy arms and legs, forged on the virtual battlefield, are always at the ready to deploy tactical maneuvers. But don't be fooled by his robust exterior; Commander Whiskertron's screen displays the innocent face of a cat, a nod to his soft spot for all creatures great and small.
