  "description": "Born from the lush circuits of the forestGreen motherboard, Shade Rocket is an enigmatic member of the WebtrES club known for his rocket-propelled limbs and love for adventure. Despite his broken screen, which he wears as a badge of honor from a daring escape through the Cybernetic Canyons, he's never let it hinder his explorations. With classic buttons that hint at a timeless style, and shades that conceal his gaze, he is both a relic of the digital past and a pioneer of the pixelated future. Shade Rocket's charm lies in his ability to outpace algorithms and soar beyond the ordinary constraints of his virtual world. His mysterious aura and the stories of his exploits keep everyone in the club guessing what he'll do next.",
