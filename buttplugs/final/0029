  "description": "Major WhiskerBox is a valorous member of the WebtrES club, known for his unique combination of feline agility and military tactical prowess. As a classic box with a sturdy structure, WhiskerBox harbors an advanced AI that enables him to switch from adorable meows to commanding battle cries in an instant. His soldier buttons are always polished, reflecting his dedication to discipline. Major WhiskerBox's limbs are those of a nimble cat, allowing him to perform incredible acrobatic feats while navigating the digital landscapes of the WebtrES universe. His screen, etched with the curious gaze of a cat, scans the surroundings with an almost supernatural awareness. The helmet addon, a relic from historical simulations, sits atop his head, symbolizing his leadership and the many pixelated battles he's led his data comrades through. Whether he's leading a charge against malware minions or curling up for a power-saving nap, Major WhiskerBox embodies the spirit of a warrior with the heart of a feline.",
