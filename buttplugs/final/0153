  "description": "Catalyst the Craftbot hails from the lush pixel forests of WebtrES, where he was once a diligent constructor bot. His forest green casing blends seamlessly with the canopies he cherishes. Catalyst is known for his peculiar cat-shaped buttons that meow with every press, a quirk programmed by his whimsical creator. With sturdy foundry-forged arms and legs, he's built to withstand the rigors of heavy crafting. Alas, his screen suffered a shattering blow during a tree-felling mishap, which left him with a unique spiderweb crack pattern. This hasn't dampened his spirits, however, as he now wields his trusty pixel hammer with even more determination. Catalyst has become a symbol of resilience and resourcefulness, inspiring fellow bots with his can-do attitude even in the face of unexpected glitches.",
