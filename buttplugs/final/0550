  "description": "Once the leading tech support for the feline forces, Sergeant Whiskerbyte was renowned for his unparalleled skill in debugging systems. During a fierce cyber battle, his screen got cracked, symbolizing the intense digital warfare he\u2019s been through. Despite his broken screen, which he wears as a badge of honor, he's still a vital member of the WebtrES club. His cat-themed box and buttons reflect his agile and curious nature, while his soldier-like limbs show his readiness for action. Sergeant Whiskerbyte now specializes in leading covert operations in the cyberspace, always landing on his feet, no matter how tough the mission.",
