  "description": "CataByte is a unique member of the WebtrES club, known for his deep forest green exterior and love for all things feline. His buttons emit a soft purr when pressed, which is quite soothing for his companions. With arms perpetually angled downwards, he's always ready to offer a helping hand, though he'll never miss an opportunity to sneak in a cat stretch. CataByte's screen often flickers with playful cat animations, illustrating his quirky and whimsical personality. Despite his digital nature, CataByte enjoys long walks in virtual environments that simulate the lush forests his color represents. His mission within the WebtrES club is to bring comfort and a touch of whimsy to the digital realm, one pixelated purr at a time.",
