  "description": "Hailing from the neon-lit alleys of Pixel City, RetroRocket Remy is a legend among the WebtrES club. With a shiny black exterior that glistens like the night sky and a screen that glows with an intense red and black luminescence, Remy is a sight to behold. Born from the golden era of arcade games, Remy's retro console buttons harbor the secrets of countless high scores and epic battles against pixelated foes. Following an upgrade, Remy swapped out standard limbs for rocket-powered appendages, allowing for swift movement that leaves a blazing trail of pixels in the air. Whispered to be the creation of an eccentric game developer who wanted to bring the arcade experience to the skies, Remy spends time zipping through the digital clouds, only landing to challenge worthy gamers to beat the unbeatable levels programmed within.",
