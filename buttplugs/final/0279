  "description": "Catalyst Cal is a quirky member of the WebtrES club, known for his classic box design and iconic red and black screen that illuminates like a beacon in the digital realm. His cat-like arms and legs give him a peculiar agility, allowing him to navigate both virtual spaces and the physical world with ease. Cal is rarely seen without his trusty glasses, which aren't just for show; they're equipped with advanced scanning technology to help him analyze codes and find vulnerabilities in systems. Despite his serious tech skills, Cal has a playful side and enjoys batting around digital yarn in his downtime. His classic buttons may look retro, but they control state-of-the-art software that keeps him at the cutting edge of the club's activities.",
