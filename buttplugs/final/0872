  "description": "Sergeant Brightbeam is a luminary member of the WebtrES club, known for his shiny yellow exterior that gleams like the midday sun. With a military-grade button interface and classic limb articulation, he stands tall and proud among his peers. Equipped with a high-precision laser screen, Brightbeam can project detailed holographic maps and targets, assisting his team in critical strategic operations. His origins trace back to a secretive tech development lab, where he was designed as a prototype for advanced robotic assistance in tactical missions. However, finding the battlegrounds too grim, Brightbeam repurposed his abilities for the greater good within the digital domain of WebtrES, where he now directs his energy toward protecting the club's virtual assets and ensuring the safety of its digital denizens.",
