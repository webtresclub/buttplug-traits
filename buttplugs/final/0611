His arms are always positioned downwards, a sign of his relaxed and approachable demeanor. Catalyte's screen features a classic display, often showcasing expressions that reflect his quirky and whimsical nature. Behind his pixels, he harbors a deep love for old-school video games and spends his downtime mastering every platformer and puzzle game the digital world has to offer. Catalyte's main quest is to bring joy and a sense of nostalgia to everyone he interacts with in the vast WebtrES realm.",
