  "description": "Once a high-ranking algorithmic tactician in the Cybernetic Feline Brigade, Sergeant WhiskerFrame's screen was cracked during the legendary Pixel Skirmish, a battle that was fought deep within the circuit boards of WebtrES. Adorned with his signature shiny black casing, he's both resilient and sleek, reflecting a dim glow from his combat scars. His buttons, shaped like cat paws, serve as a tribute to his feline comrades-in-arms. Despite the damage, his optical sensors, shielded behind sturdy glasses, can spot a digital mouse from a terabyte away. WhiskerFrame's arms and legs, built for digital warfare, now serve a peaceful purpose, as he shares his stories of byte-sized bravery with the next generation of WebtrES club members, reminding them of the importance of code and camaraderie in the face of adversity.",
