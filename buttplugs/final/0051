  "description": "Forged in the virtual foundries of WebtrES club, Sergeant Pixelbash is a digital warrior with a heart of code. Clad in forest green armor symbolizing his affinity with the digital woodlands, his buttons carry the insignia of the soldier class, ever-ready to defend his cyber comrades. With arms and legs crafted from the sturdiest pixels of the foundry, he wields his trusted pixel hammer in one hand and the emblematic firewall torch in the other, a beacon of security in the endless byte battlefields. His screen displays the classic resolution, a nod to the golden era of gaming where his legend first flickered to life. Sergeant Pixelbash stands as a guardian of the WebtrES realm, a protector of its vast and mysterious data domains.",
