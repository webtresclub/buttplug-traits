  "description": "Cattivo Corsa hails from the electric city of Pixelville, a vibrant metropolis pulsing with digital life. With a chassis painted in the vivid hue of rosso corsa, this bot stands out in any crowd. Cattivo's screen flickers with a unique red and black pattern that embodies its love for high speed and agility, much like the sports cars it idolizes. The cat-shaped buttons on its console reflect its quirky sense of humor and a love for feline companions, often meowing in binary code to communicate with its fellow WebtrES club members. Despite its racing-inspired design, Cattivo Corsa is programmed with a classic set of arms and legs, giving it a retro charm that's beloved by nostalgic enthusiasts. Cattivo's background story is filled with tales of cyber races and alley cat adventures \u2013 a perfect fusion of speed and playfulness.",
