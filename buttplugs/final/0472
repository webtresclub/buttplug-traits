  "description": "General Pixelhammer is a distinguished member of the WebtrES club, known for his striking rossoCorsa box which symbolizes his fiery passion for digital craftsmanship. His soldier buttons are always polished to perfection, reflecting his background in the pixelated armed forces where he led many successful campaigns against the glitches of the Great Data War. After being forged in the heat of the foundry, his arms and legs emerged robust and unyielding, capable of wielding his legendary hammer and trident with expert precision. The classic screen on his face, with its simple yet expressive green diode facial features, belies the complex algorithms that run beneath his exterior, allowing him to strategize and solve the most cryptic of codes. General Pixelhammer now spends his days at the WebtrES club, sharing tales of his glory and mentoring young sprites in the art of cyber-combat and integrity.",
