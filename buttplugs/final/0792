  "description": "From the cyber-streets of Meowtropolis, Sergeant Whiskerblast is the feline enforcer with a heart of steel. His orange box chassis is reinforced with the courage of a soldier, and his cat-like appendages give him the agility and stealth needed for his night patrols. Equipped with a state-of-the-art laser screen, he can scan the alleyways for trouble and project holographic maps in the blink of an eye. With the tell-tale stripes of a warrior, he's a beloved member of the WebtrES club, always ready to pounce on injustice and keep the digital realm purring with order.",
