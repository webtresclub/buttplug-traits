  "description": "Catalyst is a quirky member of the WebtrES club, known for his shiny black exterior and a penchant for all things feline. With cat-themed buttons and a display screen that's always showing adorable cat videos, he is the go-to bot for any cyber-kitty conundrum. His classic arms and legs are always on the move, tapping away at his keyboard to the rhythm of meows. Donning a sharp pair of glasses, Catalyst offers a clear vision to his fellow club members, helping them debug the most purr-plexing of codes. Beyond his programming prowess, he's also the club's unofficial DJ, scratching records with a finesse that can only be attributed to his love of cats.",
