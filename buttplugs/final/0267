  "description": "Retro Rex is an enigmatic figure in the WebtrES club, known for his striking rossoCorsa red exterior and an unbreakable passion for classic games. He sports a pair of dark shades, adding an air of mystery to his persona. Despite his modern appearance, his heart beats in 8-bit, as shown by his retroConsole buttons that have felt the touch of many a nostalgic gamer. Tragically, his screen met with an accident that left it broken, a battle scar from the countless hours spent in the digital trenches. Nevertheless, Rex's arms are always open, hand down, ready to welcome fellow enthusiasts into the fold of vintage video game love. Behind those shades, his screen flickers with the wisdom of pixelated adventures past, and in the WebtrES club, he's both a mentor and a muse, inspiring the next generation of digital connoisseurs.",
