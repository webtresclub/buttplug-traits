  "description": "Once a dedicated member of the Digital Defense Force, Sergeant Screenforge was known for his resilience and strength. His box is of a classic design, reminiscent of the computers used in the early days of digital warfare. The soldier buttons on his interface are proof of his time in service, each one representing a battle he fought valiantly. His arms and legs, crafted in the foundry, were designed to withstand the heat of battle and the weight of his mighty hammer and wrench, tools he uses to fix and fortify his fellow WebtrES club members. However, during the Great Pixel Skirmish, his screen was damaged, leaving a permanent spider-web crack as a badge of honor, displaying his sacrifice. Despite the broken screen, which he carries with pride, Sergeant Screenforge continues to serve the WebtrES community, always ready to jump into action and repair what's broken, fighting against the virus threats in the digital realm.",
