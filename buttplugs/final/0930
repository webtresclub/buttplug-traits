  "description": "ShadeTronik was once the centerpiece of a high-tech arcade in the heart of the city, a forest green beacon of gaming innovation with its classic button configuration inviting players of all ages. However, fate wasn't kind to this digital dynamo. After a dramatic showdown during a thunderstorm, a bolt of lightning struck, fracturing its screen and forever changing its digital consciousness. Refusing to be scrapped, ShadeTronik donned a pair of shades to hide its broken screen, symbolizing its new mysterious persona. It now roams the virtual world of the WebtrES club as a renegade, offering sage advice and retro gaming wisdom to those who seek the thrills of pixelated adventures. Its glitched visual input has become a source of unpredictable insights, making ShadeTronik a sought-after companion in the club.",
