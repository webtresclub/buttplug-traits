  "description": "Born from the nostalgia of the 90s, PixelSnake Retro is a digital being with an affinity for all things vintage gaming. His screen displays an endless game of snake, a testament to simpler times where a single game could provide hours of entertainment. With his classic arms and legs, he's always ready to leap into action, whether it's to show off his button-mashing skills or to strut around the WebtrES club with his sleek shades. Despite his retro console box exterior, PixelSnake Retro is a social creature who loves to connect with others over shared memories of pixelated adventures.",
