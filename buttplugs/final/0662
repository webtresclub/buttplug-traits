  "description": "Sergeant WhiskerByte is a valiant member of the WebtrES club, known for his discipline and love for retro gaming. His box is a tribute to the golden age of arcade games, and his screen always displays the fierce glow of determination reminiscent of a cat on the hunt. The buttons of a cat indicate his agility and reflexes, while his soldier-like arms and legs show that he is always ready for action. Whether he's leading a digital battalion or conquering the latest platformer, Sergeant WhiskerByte is the go-to strategist for any pixelated challenge.",
