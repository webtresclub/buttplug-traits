  "description": "Tangerine Terminal, or TT as his fellow WebtrES club members call him, is a vintage arcade machine brought to life in the digital realm. With his vibrant orange box chassis and a screen that glows with the intensity of a red-black sunset, TT is a nostalgic nod to the 80s gaming era. His classic button configuration and sturdy arms and legs are proof of his enduring design, built to withstand the countless hours of button mashing and joystick maneuvering. TT's story began in a dimly lit arcade where he was the star attraction, hosting epic battles and creating countless memories. However, when the arcade's lights dimmed for the last time, TT found himself in the WebtrES club. Now, he spends his days sharing his pixelated wisdom and challenging anyone willing to take on the games that made him a legend. TT is more than just an entertainment console; he's a keeper of history, a virtual time capsule of electronic enthusiasm and pixelated passion.",
