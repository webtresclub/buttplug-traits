  "description": "Hailing from the vibrant neon alleyways of Retro Cyberville, Catsby Pixelmix is a charming NFT character known for its vintage console box head and the classic red and black screen that always seems to be playing an enigmatic pixelated game. With its iconic cat button features, Catsby has a knack for pressing the right buttons in any social situation. The classic arms and legs suggest a timeless design, reminiscent of the golden era of arcade gaming. Catsby spends its digital days reminiscing about the glory of 8-bit adventures and bringing retro cool to the WebtrES club.",
