  "description": "Hailing from the pixelated depths of a long-forgotten arcade, SerpentoByte is a member of the elite WebtrES club known for its unique mix of retro charm and modern flair. With a body crafted from the sturdiest retro consoles, SerpentoByte's screen flickers with the cunning gaze of a digital serpent, always one step ahead in the cyber realm. Its cat-like limbs, stealthy and agile, allow it to maneuver through the webspace with ease, while the military-grade buttons attest to its strategic prowess. Donning glasses as its trusted addon, SerpentoByte sees through the complex layers of code with unmatched clarity. This enigmatic entity is not just a collector of bytes and bits but a guardian of the forgotten digital frontier, always ready to leap into action should the WebtrES club call upon its services.",
