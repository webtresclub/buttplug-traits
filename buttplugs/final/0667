  "description": "Born in the heart of an abandoned arcade, LaserByte is a member of the prestigious WebtrES club known for his retro charm and radiant personality. With his forest green exterior and classic limbs, he often reminisces about the golden days of joystick adventures and pixelated dreams. His retro console buttons are a hit at every party, offering a tactile nostalgia trip for anyone who crosses his path. LaserByte's screen, capable of emitting low-intensity laser visuals, entertains his friends with a light show straight from the neon-soaked 80s. Despite his old-school appearance, LaserByte is equipped with the latest in AI technology, allowing him to adapt and play virtually any video game from the past four decades. A true blast from the past with a beam of modern brilliance, LaserByte is the life of every gathering and an irreplaceable character within the digital collectible space.",
