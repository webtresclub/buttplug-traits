  "description": "Hailing from the digital forests of the WebtrES club, Sergeant Smash is a rough-and-ready enforcer with a penchant for order and discipline. This pixelated powerhouse is decked out in forest green, a nod to his virtual woodland origins. His screen may be broken from one too many battles, but that doesn't dampen his spirit; it's almost a badge of honor, showcasing his fearless nature. The soldier buttons hint at his military-grade programming, designed to tackle any digital skirmish head-on. Solid as the foundry arms and legs that carry him, Sergeant Smash is the go-to enforcer when the club faces any form of cyber threat. The shades he wears are not just for style\u2014they're equipped with advanced scanning technology, allowing him to analyze his surroundings for potential dangers. With a hammer in each hand, this digital soldier is always ready to forge ahead and smash through any obstacles that stand between the WebtrES club and their next adventure.",
