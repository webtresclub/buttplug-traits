Once a decorated soldier in the WebtrES army, his box is reinforced with tales of valor and victory.

The screen of Sergeant Whiskerblast flickers with the hypnotic patterns of a snake, keeping his adversaries frozen in confusion. And those aren't just any glasses; they're his visionary goggles of insight, allowing him to see through any deception.
