  "description": "Pixel Viper is a rare member of the WebtrES club, known for his love of all things retro gaming. With a screen that perpetually plays the classic 'snake' game and a console body reminiscent of the golden age of arcade games, Pixel Viper is the go-to source for vintage game trivia among his peers. His rocket-powered limbs speak to his dynamic nature, allowing him to blast off to any arcade tournament at a moment's notice. He often leaves a trail of 8-bit tunes and nostalgia in his wake, enchanting fellow club members with tales of pixelated adventures and high scores that have stood the test of time.",
