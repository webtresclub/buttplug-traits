  "description": "PixelPunk Retro hails from the golden era of arcade games, where it spent its early cycles basking in the neon glow of a bustling 80s arcade. This bot, encased in a shiny black exterior that reflects its cool and mysterious past, has been a loyal companion to many gamers. Its retro console buttons have been mashed in excitement and pounded in frustration, bearing witness to countless high-score attempts. Unfortunately, during an intense gaming marathon, its screen suffered a crack that now mars its once pristine pixel display. Despite its broken screen, PixelPunk Retro wears its battle scars with pride, knowing that each crack tells a story of a challenge faced and a game well-played. It now spends its time as a treasured member of the WebtrES club, sharing tales of pixels past and inspiring a new generation of game lovers with its classic charm and enduring spirit.",
