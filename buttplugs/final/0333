  "description": "Hailing from the digital forests of Siliconia, Sergeant CyberBeam is a tactical expert in the WebtrES club. His forest green casing blends seamlessly with the lush, pixelated underbrush of his home terrain. Outfitted with soldier-grade buttons, he's always prepared for a mission. His arms rest at ease when not in action, but they're capable of rapid deployment when the situation demands. With a screen that can emit a focused laser beam, CyberBeam is a formidable foe in virtual battles. Even in times of peace, his stoic presence is a reassuring sight to his fellow WebtrES members, as he stands vigilant, safeguarding the data streams and maintaining the club's order.",
