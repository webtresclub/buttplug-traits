  "description": "Once a valiant member of the Bit Battalion, PixelTrooper Retro now spends his days as a guardian of the WebtrES club. With his camouflage box helmet reminiscent of old-school gaming textures, and retro console buttons that he proudly wears like medals of honor, he stands as a nostalgic tribute to the golden era of 8-bit gaming. His classic arms and legs are hardwired for action, while his screen face, with its vintage green pixel glow, expresses a range of emotions from determination to pixelated mirth. Despite the ever-evolving digital landscape, PixelTrooper Retro is a steadfast symbol of where it all began, fiercely protective of the club's digital heritage and always ready to jump into action with the hum of chiptunes in his audio output.",
