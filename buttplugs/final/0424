  "description": "Catalyst Clyde is a retro bot with an adventurous spirit, known for his rosso corsa boxy frame that reflects his love for speed and vintage race cars. His laid-back personality is symbolized by his cool shades, which he never removes, claiming they help him see the world in a more 'chill' light. Despite his broken screen, a reminder of a daring escapade gone wrong while chasing digital mice in the cyber alleyways, Clyde remains the life of the party in the WebtrES club. His cat-themed buttons are a nod to his curious and independent nature, often leading him to unexpected situations. With arms perpetually relaxed at his sides, Clyde is always ready to lend a hand, or rather a thumbs-up, to his fellow club members, encouraging them to find the fun in every pixel.",
