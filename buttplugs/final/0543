  "description": "Cathode Clyde is a retro-inspired NFT from the eclectic WebtrES club, known for his pixel-perfect smile and his affinity for vintage tech. With a classic box-shaped body, this digital denizen harks back to the golden age of arcade games, sporting a screen that often displays an enigmatic, old-school cat face. Clyde's buttons are reminiscent of the tactile feedback of arcade machines, and he stands on his sturdy classic legs, always ready to jump into action. As a lover of all things nostalgic, he spends his digital days reminiscing about the simple joys of 8-bit adventures and is always eager to share a pixelated story or two with anyone who appreciates the charm of yesteryears gaming culture.",
