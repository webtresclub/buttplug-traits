  "description": "Sergeant PixelHammer is a distinguished member of the WebtrES club, known for his unwavering dedication to the art of digital craftsmanship. Born in the pixelated foundries of a bygone era, he was forged in the fires of the earliest gaming consoles. His screen displays the classic 'Space Invaders' as a tribute to where it all began. Equipped with arms and legs from the sturdiest foundry, he wields a hammer and a wrench with the precision of a skilled soldier in the battlefield of gaming hardware. Sergeant PixelHammer's mission is to protect the legacy of retro gaming and ensure that the spirit of the arcade lives on in the hearts and circuits of every WebtrES club member.",
