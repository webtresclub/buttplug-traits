  "description": "Sergeant LaserByte is a high-ranking member of the WebtrES club, known for his striking rossoCorsa exterior and his unwavering discipline. Built in the era of pixel wars, he is equipped with state-of-the-art laser screen technology, allowing him to project high-intensity beams to communicate and, if necessary, defend his digital comrades. His buttons carry the marks of a soldier, each one representing a campaign he has valiantly fought in the cyberspace. His arms and legs, also reminiscent of a soldier's, are reinforced with code steel, making him both a formidable ally and a daunting foe. Despite his military-grade hardware, Sergeant LaserByte is fiercely loyal to his fellow club members and upholds a code of honor, always fighting for the freedom and security of the WebtrES realm.",
