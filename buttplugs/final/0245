  "description": "Once a high-tech display unit in the bustling digital metropolis of WebtrES city, Cataclysm Forge earned its name after an unfortunate encounter with a virtual spider virus. Sporting a shiny black exterior, this machine was the envy of all until its screen was shattered in the midst of a heated battle to fend off the invasive code. Equipped with foundry-style arms and legs, forged in the fires of the city's data cores, it once manipulated code with the precision of a craftsman. The cat-shaped buttons on its panel hint at its playful past, a remnant of its days as a feline-themed gaming console. Now, wielding a hammer in one hand and pliers in the other, Cataclysm Forge roams the alleys of WebtrES, on a personal quest to repair its broken screen and eradicate software bugs, hoping to once again display the vibrant vistas of its digital world.",
