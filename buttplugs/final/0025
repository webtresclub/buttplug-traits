  "description": "Catarina Pixelwhisker is an enigmatic member of the WebtrES club, known for her shiny black exterior and retro console buttons that reflect her love for classic video games. Her limbs and facial display are reminiscent of a sleek black cat, with an attitude to match. She's rarely seen without her iconic glasses, which she claims enhance her ability to spot the finest details in both games and code. As a feline-inspired tech enthusiast, Catarina spends her nights contributing to open-source projects and her days basking in the soft glow of CRT monitors, always ready to lend a helping paw to fellow club members in need of debugging expertise.",
