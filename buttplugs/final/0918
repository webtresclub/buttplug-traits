  "description": "Hailing from the neon-lit corners of the WebtrES club, Pixela Serpens is a unique NFT with a penchant for nostalgia and high-speed adventure. Her box is a homage to retro gaming consoles, and her screen always displays an ever-changing pattern that resembles a playful snake, a nod to one of the most iconic games of the early mobile era. Her buttons, charmingly shaped like cats, are a tribute to her creator's love for felines and the quirkiness of internet culture. With rocket-powered limbs, Pixela is known for her ability to blast through cyberspace at incredible speeds, leaving a trail of pixelated stardust in her wake. Whether she's racing through digital landscapes or simply enjoying the camaraderie of fellow NFTs in the club, her presence is always a blast from the past with a twist of futuristic flair.",
