  "description": "Hailing from the digital foundries of WebtrES club, Sergeant WhiskerForge is a formidable figure with a soldier\u2019s heart and a craftsman\u2019s soul. Originally programmed to lead armies of code into the battles of cyberspace, WhiskerForge found his true calling in the blazing forges where the arms and legs of his fellow bots are crafted. His classic screen face, framed by feline box features, displays a stern yet wise countenance, and his trusty hammer is always at the ready for when he needs to shape molten metal or command his troops. The glasses he wears are not just a fashion statement but a tool that provides a HUD with precision metrics for crafting. Despite his tough exterior, Sergeant WhiskerForge has a soft spot for kittens and spends his downtime mentoring young bots in the art of metallurgy and strategy.",
