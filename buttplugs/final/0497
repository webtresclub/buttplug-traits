  "description": "Born in the heat of a molten metal factory, PixelPuncher is a rare entity from the WebtrES club with the tough exterior of foundry-forged arms and legs. His box is painted in the iconic rossoCorsa, a reminder of his love for speed and action, which pairs perfectly with his retro console buttons that always keep him in a gaming state of mind. His screen wears the classic, nostalgic expression of a vintage arcade, resonating with the bleeps and bloops of a bygone era. Despite his tough appearance, PixelPuncher is known for his friendly competitive spirit, often challenging fellow club members to old-school gaming showdowns. His favorite pastime includes hammering high scores and sparking up conversations about the golden age of gaming.",
