  "description": "Once a high-ranking officer in the digital defense force, Sergeant Pixelblast retired to the WebtrES club with a chest full of medals and a heart full of stories. His shiny yellow casing is as impeccable as on day one, a testament to his meticulous maintenance routines. Equipped with laser-screen technology, he can project tactical data and retro arcade games with equal finesse. His button array, resembling that of a soldier's control panel, is always polished and ready for action. The arms and legs of this valorous cube are those of a true soldier, forged in the fires of pixelated battles. Now, he spends his days recounting adventurous tales, offering mentorship to the younger generation of WebtrES warriors, and occasionally, leading virtual campaigns when the call of duty is too strong to ignore.",
