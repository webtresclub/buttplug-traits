  "description": "Hailing from the digital realm of vintage gaming, Pixel Pilot Helm is a nostalgic hero whose love for 8-bit adventures knows no bounds. With a retro console box head, classic button interface, and a nifty helmet equipped with high-tech visor for scanning arcade galaxies, this character was once a sidekick in a legendary pixelated space shooter game. After the game lost popularity, Helm broke out of the digital confines and joined the WebtrES club, where he now spends his days reminiscing about the golden era of gaming and sharing cheat codes and easter eggs from the bygone arcade epoch. Helm's arms forever poised hand-down, he's always ready to lend a hand (or a joystick move) to fellow retro aficionados in the club.",
