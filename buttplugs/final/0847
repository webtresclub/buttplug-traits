  "description": "Hailing from the digital frontlines of the retro gaming universe, SerpentByte Sergeant is a heroic figure in the WebtrES club. His screen face is perpetually locked in the classic game of Snake, a reflection of his strategic and never-ending quest to overcome challenges. His retro console box and buttons hark back to a simpler time when pixels reigned supreme. Outfitted with sturdy soldier arms and legs, he is always battle-ready, prepared to defend the nostalgic realms of 8-bit glory. The sturdy helmet addon is both his trademark and a symbol of his unwavering commitment to his pixelated comrades. Whether he's leading a campaign against glitch invaders or standing sentinel at the arcade gates, SerpentByte Sergeant is a steadfast guardian of gaming's golden era.",
