  "description": "Once the mainframe guardian of the WebtrES club, Commander Pixel has a storied background in cyber defense. With a soldier's box and limbs, he's always at the ready. His screen flickers with red and black hues, a reminder of the digital battles he's faced against malware invaders. The classic buttons on his chest are his medals of honor, each representing a major victory in keeping the club's data secure. Commander Pixel may have been programmed for war, but his true mission is to protect and serve the pixelated denizens of the WebtrES club.",
