  "description": "Catalyst Cal is a well-known figure in the WebtrES club, sporting a shiny yellow box with an impeccable gleam. He's got the classic button setup, which makes him a reliable choice for those who appreciate a touch of old-school charm. His arms and legs come from the foundry, giving him an industrial, sturdy look that's as tough as the metalwork he's passionate about. Cal's screen boasts a unique cat display, often misleading others into thinking he's all fun and games, but behind those cool shades, he's a calculating mastermind with a secret fondness for felines. With a trusty hammer in one hand and an air of mystery around him, Catalyst Cal is the go-to bot for both heavy-duty construction projects and complex strategizing sessions in the club.",
