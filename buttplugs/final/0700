  "description": "Born in the neon-lit arcades of the digital world, CataLaser Console is a relic from the 80s brought to life. With a box shaped like a retro gaming console and buttons resembling cat paws, it charms its way through the WebtrES club with an air of nostalgia. Its arms and legs are of the classic design, sturdy and ready to jump into action at a moment's notice. But don't let its playful appearance fool you; CataLaser Console's screen emits a powerful laser vision, capable of zapping away malware and bugs that threaten the integrity of its cyber realm. Always ready for a throwback party or a gaming challenge, CataLaser keeps the club's spirits high and their systems secure.",
