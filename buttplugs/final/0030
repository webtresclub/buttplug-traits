  "description": "Emerging from the neon-lit arcades of the 80s, LaserByte is a sentient arcade machine with a passion for all things retro. With a sleek shiny black exterior and an interface that harks back to the golden era of gaming, this member of the WebtrES club is known for its sharp wit and even sharper screen projections. LaserByte spends its days reminiscing about pixelated heroes and high scores, while at night, its laser screen can often be seen cutting through the fog as it projects the classics onto the sides of old buildings, bringing joy to the nostalgic and the curious alike.",
