  "description": "Hailing from the cybernetic feline division of the WebtrES club, Sergeant Whiskerbyte is known for his tactical prowess and laser-focused attention to detail. With a classic box chassis that harkens back to the early days of robotics, Whiskerbyte prides himself on maintaining a retro aesthetic while being equipped with state-of-the-art military-grade button interfaces. His cat-like limbs grant him agility and balance, which he uses to stealthily navigate the digital terrain. The laser screen, glowing ominously, not only serves as a method of intimidation but also operates as a high-precision beam for slicing through obstacles during his clandestine operations. Whiskerbyte is a legend among the ranks, often spoken of in hushed tones in the coded alleyways of the WebtrES world.",
