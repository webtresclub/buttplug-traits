  "description": "Catalyst is a sleek member of the WebtrES club known for its shiny black exterior and mysterious green pixelated visage. Originally a part of a high-end gaming console from the neon-soaked arcades of CyberTokyo, Catalyst gained sentience through a freak power surge during an intense lightning storm. With classic buttons that evoke a sense of nostalgia, and cat-like arms and legs, Catalyst now roams the digital and physical worlds. Although it doesn't speak, it communicates through blips and bleeps that somehow convey deep wisdom and hacker-like knowledge. This enigmatic being spends its nights prowling the information superhighway, casting an ever-watchful eye over the data streams, and protecting the WebtrES club from cyber threats.",
