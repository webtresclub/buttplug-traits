  "description": "Hailing from the digital frontlines, Sergeant PixelShade is a tactical legend in the WebtrES club. With a classic chassis that boasts a robust build, he's survived countless software skirmishes and hardware battles. His soldier-style buttons and limbs are a testament to his militant precision, always ready to deploy the next command with unyielding accuracy. The red and black screen, reflecting his no-nonsense attitude, glows with the data of his next mission. Known for his cool demeanor under fire, PixelShade never goes into action without his trusty shades, which are said to shield his vision from the blinding glare of enemy firewalls. Rumor has it, those shades have seen more action than most circuits could handle. Sgt. PixelShade is the go-to bot when the WebtrES club needs someone to march into the heart of cyber chaos and emerge with victory codes.",
