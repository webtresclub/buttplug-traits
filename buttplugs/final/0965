  "description": "Once the pinnacle of retro gaming, Sergeant PixelBlast defended digital realms with the heart of a warrior. Clad in forest green armor, he was known for his unyielding bravery in the face of countless arcade battles. The retro console buttons on his chest served as a testament to countless hours of gaming glory. However, in a fierce combat against the notorious Glitch Gang, his screen was tragically cracked, leaving a spider-web pattern that marks his valiant sacrifice. Despite his broken screen, Sergeant PixelBlast continues to stand tall, inspiring every member of the WebtrES club with his resilience and unwavering spirit. Rumor has it that he's still operational, ready to jump back into action if ever the call of duty pixelates his path again.",
