  "description": "Born in a digital realm where 8-bit graphics and chiptune music reign supreme, Retro Rocket Rascal is a quirky character from the WebtrES club. Known for his charming cat button console with a sleek retro design, his love for arcade classics is only matched by his need for speed, thanks to his trusty rocket arms and legs. Sporting stylish shades over his red and black screen, this pixelated adventurer zips through cyberspace, leaving a trail of high scores and nostalgic memories in his wake.",
