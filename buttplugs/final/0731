With a chassis of shiny black and the classic console buttons, he's a nostalgic nod to the gamers of yesteryear. His arms and legs, forged from the strongest digital steel, allow him to wield his trusty hammer with precision, ensuring each pixel is perfectly placed. His screen, which perpetually displays the hypnotic patterns of the 'snake' game, is a tribute to one of the earliest digital pastimes.
