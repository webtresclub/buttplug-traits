  "description": "Once a proud display unit in the WebtrES club, Sergeant Forge was renowned for his gleaming rossoCorsa chassis and lightning-fast response buttons. But the tides of fate can be harsh. After a notorious scuffle at the Foundry, where he valiantly defended his fellow club members, his screen was shattered and his arms and legs battered. Despite the damage, he refuses to stand down. His helmet, a token from the skirmish, now serves as a symbol of his undying spirit and determination. Even with a broken screen, Sergeant Forge continues to inspire other WebtrES club members with his unwavering courage and resilience.",
