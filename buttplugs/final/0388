  "description": "Catalyst Rocketpaws is a high-flying member of the WebtrES club known for her lightning-fast reflexes and an adventurous spirit that's as boundless as the skies she soars through. With a chassis designed to resemble her favorite animal, the cat, she's not just another pretty screen. Her rocket arms and legs allow her to zip through the clouds, performing aerial acrobatics that leave onlookers in awe. The classic button configuration on her front panel may look retro, but it's full of state-of-the-art tech that can control anything from satellite arrays to laser light shows. Her cat-themed screen face, complete with glowing yellow eyes, is both a display of her playful personality and a homage to her feline inspirations. She spends her downtime watching over the WebtrES community, always ready to blast off at a moment's notice to help a friend in need or to chase the sun just for the thrill of it.",
