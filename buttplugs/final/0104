  "description": "Once a state-of-the-art bot designed to explore the cosmic wilds, Cataclysmic Cato's journey took a turn when a meteor shower shattered its navigation screen. Stranded on a distant planet, Cato adapted by using its cat button interface to communicate with the local feline lifeforms. Donning a salvaged helmet from a space wreck, Cato is now a beloved figure among the cosmic alley cats, leading them in a quest to repair its screen and resume the interstellar adventure.",
