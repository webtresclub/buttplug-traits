  "description": "Hailing from the digital forests of WebtrES, Laser General T-85 is a formidable figure. Built during the Pixel Wars, T-85 was initially programmed as a soldier bot, equipped with laser vision to navigate through the densest thickets and a sturdy forest green exterior that provided camouflage among the foliage. After the wars ended, T-85 found a new purpose in the club, repurposing its military-grade buttons for creating mesmerizing light shows that entertain and inspire fellow club members. With its classic arms and legs designed for agility and strength, T-85 now leads expeditions into the unknown realms of WebtrES, always ready to protect its community with a blend of strategy and heart.",
