  "description": "Volt is a retro-inspired oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With its classic box design and retro console buttons, it exudes a nostalgic charm. Volt's arms and legs have a rugged foundry look, symbolizing its durability and strength. Although its screen may be broken, Volt's internal circuits and components are still fully functional, making it a valuable asset in the club's endeavors.",
