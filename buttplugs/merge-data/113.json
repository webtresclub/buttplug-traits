  "description": "Vincent is a robot oscilloscope named after its vibrant red color, reminiscent of the iconic Ferrari Rosso Corsa. With its box-like structure and soldier-themed buttons, Vincent has a strong and sturdy appearance. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, but it compensates for this with a pair of stylish glasses that it wears. Vincent is a proud member of the WebtrES club, standing out with its unique traits and abilities.",
