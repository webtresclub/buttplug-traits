  "description": "Felix the Oscibot is a unique robot with an oscilloscope theme. With its vibrant orange box and cat-shaped buttons, it stands out from the crowd. Its arms and legs are made from sturdy foundry materials, giving it a strong and durable build. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, which adds to its eclectic charm.",
