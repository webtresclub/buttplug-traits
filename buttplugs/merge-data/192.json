  "description": "RetroScope is a sentient oscilloscope-themed robot with a sleek, shiny black box body adorned with cat-shaped buttons for a touch of whimsy. Its arms and legs are also designed to resemble the graceful curves of a cat, allowing it to move with agility and precision. Its screen features a classic design, harkening back to the golden era of analog technology. To complete its stylish aesthetic, RetroScope wears a pair of fashionable glasses as an accessory, giving it a scholarly and sophisticated appearance.",
