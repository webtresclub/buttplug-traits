  "description": "RetroScope is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a vibrant orange box and a retro console button interface. Its arms and legs are designed to have a hand-down posture, allowing it to interact with its surroundings effectively. The screen unfortunately is broken, but it compensates for this with a stylish helmet addon. RetroScope is a proud member of the WebtrES club, utilizing its oscilloscope capabilities to contribute to the club's advancements in technology and digital innovation.",
