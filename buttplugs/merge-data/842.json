  "description": "Circuit is a unique robot with an oscilloscope theme. Its box-like body resembles a cat, with classic buttons and a broken screen. Its arms and legs are in a 'handDown' position, giving it a playful and friendly appearance. Circuit also wears a pair of glasses as an accessory, adding a touch of intelligence to its design.",
