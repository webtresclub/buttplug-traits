  "description": "Copper is a vintage oscilloscope-themed robot, part of the WebtrES club. Its box is adorned in a vibrant forest green color, reminiscent of the lush depths of a vibrant woodland. With its sturdy soldier buttons, Copper exudes a sense of strength and determination. Its arms and legs, forged in the foundry, possess a robustness that allows it to navigate any terrain with ease. The classic screen on its chest displays intricate waveforms and data, making Copper a valuable asset in deciphering complex signals and patterns.",
