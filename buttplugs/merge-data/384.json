  "description": "RetroBot is a vintage-inspired oscilloscope-themed robot, proudly representing the WebtrES club. With its striking rossoCorsa-colored box and soldier-like arms and legs, RetroBot stands out among its robotic peers. Its broken screen adds a touch of mystery and curiosity to its appearance, leaving others wondering about its past adventures. To complete its unique style, RetroBot wears sleek shades that give it a cool and enigmatic vibe. Despite its broken screen, RetroBot remains fully functional and ready to showcase its abilities.",
