  "description": "Oscillotron is a retro-themed robot with the ability to act as an oscilloscope. Its body resembles a vintage console with buttons, while its arms and legs are designed like a soldier. The screen on its chest displays a cute cat image, adding a touch of whimsy to its appearance. Oscillotron is a proud member of the WebtrES club, where it showcases its unique abilities and interacts with other robots.",
