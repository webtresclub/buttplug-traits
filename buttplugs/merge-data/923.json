  "description": "Circuitrex is an oscilloscope-themed robot and a proud member of the WebtrES club. With its vibrant orange box and classic-style buttons, it stands out among its robotic peers. Its broken screen adds a touch of uniqueness, while its hand-down arms and legs allow it to maneuver with precision. Circuitrex is always ready for action, with its trusty helmet addon providing extra protection during its adventures.",
