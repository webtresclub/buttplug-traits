  "description": "Oscillo is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With its vibrant red casing, known as rossoCorsa, Oscillo stands out among other robots. Its cat-shaped buttons add a touch of playfulness to its design. Oscillo's arms and legs are in the shape of hands pointing downwards, symbolizing its ability to manipulate and interact with electronic components. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, which gives it a unique and mysterious appearance. Despite this flaw, Oscillo's functionality is unaffected, and it continues to excel in its role as an oscilloscope robot.",
