  "description": "Retrotron is a vintage-inspired oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With a classic box design and soldier-like arms and legs, Retrotron brings a nostalgic charm to any technological setting. Although its screen may be broken, Retrotron compensates with its exceptional helmet addon, which enhances its functionality in various ways.",
