  "description": "Volt is a unique oscilloscope-themed robot known for its vibrant orange box and sturdy soldier buttons. Its arms and legs are designed with hands facing downwards, giving it a distinctive appearance. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, adding an element of mystery to its capabilities. To compensate for the damaged screen, Volt is equipped with a protective helmet as an add-on feature. It is a remarkable creation and a proud member of the WebtrES club.",
