  "description": "Copper is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a classic box body and a set of sleek shades. Its arms and legs are made from sturdy foundry materials, giving it a strong and durable build. Although its screen is broken, Copper's programming enables it to compensate for this limitation. It is a member of the WebtrES club, a community of robots who explore the depths of the internet.",
