  "description": "RetroScope is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a nostalgic touch. Its vintage design harkens back to the golden era of gaming consoles. Equipped with foundry arms and legs, RetroScope is a versatile and nimble companion. Its cat-shaped buttons add a hint of playfulness to its appearance. The prominent screen displays a classic game of snake, reminding everyone of the good old days. To complete its retro ensemble, RetroScope wears a pair of stylish glasses, adding a touch of sophistication to its overall look.",
