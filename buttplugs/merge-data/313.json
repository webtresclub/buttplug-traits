  "description": "RocketBox is a unique oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With its classic box-like body, it is equipped with rocket-powered arms and legs, which give it unparalleled speed and agility. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, making it unable to display visual data. Nevertheless, RocketBox compensates for this with its exceptional ability scores and skills.",
