  "description": "Retrocat is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a unique twist. Its design combines the nostalgia of retro consoles with the functionality of an oscilloscope. With its classic arms and legs, Retrocat is a stylish and eccentric addition to the WebtrES club. Its screen showcases an adorable cat, adding a touch of cuteness to its overall appearance. To top it off, Retrocat is always rocking a pair of cool shades, giving it a sleek and mysterious vibe.",
