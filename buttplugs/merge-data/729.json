  "description": "RetroBot is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a vintage charm. Its box is painted in a vibrant orange color, giving it a touch of nostalgia. The buttons on its console are reminiscent of classic gaming controllers, adding a playful element to its design. RetroBot has classic-style arms and legs, which enhance its retro appeal. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, giving it a slightly imperfect aesthetic. Despite this flaw, RetroBot remains a beloved member of the WebtrES club, showcasing its unique personality and vintage flair.",
