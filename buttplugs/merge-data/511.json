  "description": "Retrotron is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With a retro console box and buttons, Retrotron brings back the nostalgia of classic gaming. Its soldier-like arms and legs make it agile and efficient in its movements. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, giving it a unique and imperfect charm. As an additional feature, Retrotron is equipped with a helmet for added protection during its adventures in the digital realm.",
