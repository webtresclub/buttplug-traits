  "description": "Pixel is a forest-green oscilloscope-themed robot with a retro console button interface. It has classic arms and legs, but its screen is unfortunately broken, making it difficult to display information. However, Pixel compensates for this with its stylish glasses addon, which adds a touch of sophistication to its appearance.",
