  "description": "RetroBot is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With its shiny yellow box, classic arms and legs, and retro console buttons, RetroBot brings a nostalgic charm wherever it goes. While its screen may be broken, RetroBot compensates with its exceptional abilities and skills. Its ability scores range from 0 to 10, including hp, charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. RetroBot's alignment is determined by its programming and values, which promote fairness, creativity, and a love for all things vintage.",
