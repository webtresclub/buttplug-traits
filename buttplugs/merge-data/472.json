  "description": "Circuitron is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With a sleek and vibrant red body, Circuitron is known as the 'rossoCorsa' within the club. Its soldier-themed buttons add an element of strength and agility to its design, perfectly complemented by its foundry arms and legs that exude power and durability. The classic screen provides a nostalgic touch, while the addition of glasses enhances Circuitron's intelligence and perception capabilities.",
