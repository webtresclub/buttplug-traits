  "description": "Analogus is a vintage-inspired oscilloscope robot that belongs to the prestigious WebtrES club. With its retro console box and buttons, it exudes a nostalgic charm. Its arms and legs resemble those of a cat, giving it a playful and agile appearance. The screen, shaped like a cat, adds a touch of whimsy to Analogus' design. This robot is not just a visual delight but also a master of data interpretation and analysis.",
