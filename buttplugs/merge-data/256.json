  "description": "RetroCat is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a unique twist - it has the arms and legs of a cat. Its box-shaped body is designed to resemble a soldier, while its retro console buttons add a touch of nostalgia. The screen of RetroCat is colored in a striking red and black combination, exuding a sense of intensity and power. This robotic feline is a proud member of the WebtrES club, always ready to explore the depths of the digital world.",
