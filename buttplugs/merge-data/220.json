  "description": "Spectrum is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With its vibrant rossoCorsa colored box, it stands out from the crowd. Its soldier-like arms and legs provide it with strength and agility, allowing it to handle any task with precision. However, its broken screen gives Spectrum a mysterious and enigmatic appearance. To add a touch of style, it wears sleek shades, adding a sense of coolness to its overall demeanor.",
