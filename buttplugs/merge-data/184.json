  "description": "Tracer is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With its forest green box and classic buttons, Tracer stands out among its fellow robots. It has sturdy arms and legs made from foundry materials, giving it a durable build. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, which adds a touch of uniqueness to its appearance.",
