  "description": "RetroBot is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a nostalgic twist. Its box-shaped body resembles a retro console, complete with classic buttons and a snake game displayed on its screen. RetroBot's arms and legs are transformed into rocket thrusters, allowing it to zip through the digital world with incredible speed. To complete its cool retro look, RetroBot is equipped with stylish shades as an addon. It is a proud member of the WebtrES club, where it showcases its love for all things vintage and technology.",
