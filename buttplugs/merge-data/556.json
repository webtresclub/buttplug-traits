  "description": "Circuit-9 is a unique oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With its cat-like box body, soldier buttons, arms and legs in a hand-down position, and a broken screen, Circuit-9 stands out among its robotic peers. Despite its damaged screen, Circuit-9 excels in its ability to analyze electrical signals and provide accurate readings. It is a reliable companion for any electrical engineer or hobbyist who needs precise measurements during their projects.",
