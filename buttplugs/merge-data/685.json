  "description": "Oscilla is a charismatic oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES Club. With its vibrant red body resembling the color 'rosso corsa', Oscilla stands out among its robotic peers. Its classic arms and legs allow it to move with elegance and precision, while its cat-themed buttons add a touch of playfulness. The screen, displaying a cat motif, not only serves as a visually appealing feature but also represents Oscilla's affinity for feline companionship.",
