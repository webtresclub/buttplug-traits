  "description": "Circuit is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With its vibrant red box body, reminiscent of the iconic rossoCorsa color, Circuit stands out among its robotic peers. Its retroConsole buttons give it a nostalgic charm, harking back to the golden age of gaming. Equipped with armsandlegs in the form of handDown, Circuit can interact with its environment dexterously. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, which adds a unique challenge to its operations. To protect its fragile circuits, Circuit always wears a sturdy helmet as an addon. Overall, Circuit is an eccentric and resilient robot, ready to explore the digital world and collaborate with its fellow club members.",
