  "description": "Circuit Breaker is an oscilloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With a sturdy soldier box body and arms and legs made from foundry materials, Circuit Breaker is a formidable companion. However, its screen is unfortunately broken, limiting its visual capabilities. To compensate for this, Circuit Breaker is equipped with a helmet addon, which enhances its overall functionality. Despite its damaged screen, Circuit Breaker excels in its ability to analyze and interpret electronic waveforms.",
