  "description": "RetroBot is an oscilloscope-themed robot with a nostalgic touch. Its box-like body resembles a retro console, complete with classic soldier buttons. The arms and legs have a timeless design, reminiscent of a bygone era. The screen, unfortunately, is broken, giving RetroBot a unique and imperfect charm. As an additional feature, it wears a helmet for added protection. This robot is a proud member of the WebtrES club.",
