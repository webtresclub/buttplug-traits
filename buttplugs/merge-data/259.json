  "description": "Rosso is a unique osciloscope-themed robot who is part of the WebtrES club. With its vibrant red body and black accents, Rosso stands out in the crowd. Its body, known as 'rossoCorsa', is a meticulously crafted box that houses its advanced circuitry and functionality. The 'cat' buttons on its surface provide Rosso with intuitive control and navigation capabilities. Its arms and legs, made by the skilled craftsmen at the 'foundry', ensure precision movement and agility. The striking 'redBlack' screen acts as both its visual output and input interface, displaying data and capturing user interactions.",
