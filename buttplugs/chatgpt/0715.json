  "Description": "Pixel Purrer is a unique member of the WebtrES club, known for his love of retro gaming and cool composure. With a box shaped like a cat's head and a screen that perpetually plays the classic game Snake, he's a nostalgic sight in the digital world. His retro console buttons and classic arms and legs give him an old-school vibe, while the sleek shades he wears speak to his laid-back, too-cool-for-school attitude. Pixel Purrer spends his days reminiscing about the golden era of gaming and hosting throwback game nights for fellow club members."
