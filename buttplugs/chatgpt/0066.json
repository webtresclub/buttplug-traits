  "Name": "ForgeMaster Flex",
  "Description": "Once the leading edge of gaming technology, ForgeMaster Flex was the go-to arcade machine for the hottest games in the neon-lit halls of the 80s. However, a fateful encounter with a rogue player who took losing a bit too seriously left his screen with a distinctive spiderweb crack. Unfazed, Flex picked up his trusty hammer and wrench, deciding that if he couldn't run games, he'd build them instead. He became a legend in the WebtrES club for his ability to forge new paths where others saw dead ends, embodying the spirit of creativity and resilience in the face of adversity."
