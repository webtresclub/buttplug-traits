"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Pixel Snake Crafter\",\n  \"Description\": \"Pixel Snake Crafter, known as 'PSC' to his friends, was once a simple retro console lost in a digital world of forgotten games. One day, after a jolt of rogue code, PSC came to life with a shiny yellow exterior and a screen that perpetually plays the classic 'Snake' game. With arms and legs forged from the very foundry that once melted old tech into oblivion, he fashioned himself a pair of round glasses, giving him an intellectual look. PSC now roams the WebtrES club, using his trusty hammer to repair broken code and a soldering iron to enhance the capabilities of his fellow members. He's a legend among the pixelated, a craftsman with a heart of gold, and a knack for fixing things that seem beyond repair.\"\n}\n```"
