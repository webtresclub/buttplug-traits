  "Name": "LaserByte",
  "Description": "LaserByte hails from the depths of the ForestGreen Woods, a place where technology and nature exist in a peculiar harmony. Originally a guardian of the digital flora and fauna, LaserByte was known for its classic button interface, which allowed it to interact with both organic and inorganic matter with precision. Its signature handDown arms give it a relaxed yet ready posture, indicative of its dual role as protector and casual wanderer of the woods. The most striking feature, however, is its laser screen, which not only displays its emotive digital eyes but can also project intense beams of light to carve paths through the undergrowth or send signals to other members of the WebtrES club. LaserByte is a beacon in the pixelated darkness, a friend to lost travelers, and a silent keeper of the forest's secret knowledge."
