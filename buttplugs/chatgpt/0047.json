"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Major Whiskerbyte\",\n  \"Description\": \"Hailing from the digital realm of WebtrES, Major Whiskerbyte is known for his striking rossoCorsa box chassis adorned with cat-themed buttons that hint at his feline agility despite his robust soldier-like arms and legs. His screen displays a fierce red and black pattern, symbolizing his readiness for virtual combat. The helmet atop his box is not just for show; it's a relic from the ancient Pixel Wars, where he served with distinction. Off the battlefield, he's a guardian of the club's lore and a mentor to rookie members, always prepared to lend a metallic hand or share tales of his pixelated adventures.\"\n}\n```"
