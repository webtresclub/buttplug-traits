  "Name": "Sergeant Whiskertron",
  "Description": "Once a state-of-the-art multimedia entertainment unit, Sergeant Whiskertron was adored by the family that owned him, particularly for the purr-fect cat videos he displayed. However, during a mysterious power surge on a stormy night, he gained sentience and a rugged pair of soldier arms and legs. With his screen cracked in the chaos, he now roams the digital world searching for the code that will repair his beloved display. His loyalty and determination make him a valued member of the WebtrES club, as he tirelessly works to keep the peace and order in the digital realm, all while hoping to once again show the world the cat content it so dearly misses."
