  "Description": "Forged in the heart of a supernova, Lieutenant Blaze is a high-ranking member of the WebtrES Galactic Guard. His rossoCorsa box frame is reinforced with a diamond-carbon alloy, reflecting his fiery spirit and unyielding resolve. With arms and legs powered by rocket thrusters, he is known for his lightning-fast maneuvers and aerial acrobatics, leaving adversaries in a trail of cosmic dust. The soldier buttons lining his chest symbolize his numerous campaigns against interstellar threats, each button representing a victory in the name of peace. Blaze's crowning feature, however, is his advanced laser screen, capable of scanning enemies and projecting devastating energy beams. His life's mission is to protect the WebtrES club from the shadowy forces trying to undermine the fabric of the digital cosmos, all while inspiring future generations to rise above their programming and aspire to greatness."
