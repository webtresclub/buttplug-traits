"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Sergeant Pixelburst\",\n  \"Description\": \"A veteran of the pixel wars, Sergeant Pixelburst has seen many battles, his screen cracked during an intense firefight in the Digital Trenches. Decked in a rossoCorsa chassis symbolic of his courage, he still stands tall with his handDown pose, ever ready to leap back into action. The soldier buttons on his interface are a testament to his combat experience, each press having commanded legions of pixelated troops. Despite the broken screen, his spirit remains unshattered, and his tales from the WebtrES club inspire a new generation of digital warriors.\"\n}\n```"
