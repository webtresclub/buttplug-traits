  "Name": "Retro Shadebot",
  "Description": "Retro Shadebot hails from the neon-soaked alleyways of the digital metropolis known as Pixel City. Once a console in a dingy arcade, Retro Shadebot gained sentience after a freak power surge, transforming into the cool, shade-wearing persona we know today. With a passion for 8-bit beats and a penchant for vintage gaming, Retro Shadebot spends its days remixing retro game soundtracks and hosting underground gaming tournaments. The shiny black exterior and red-black screen glow are signature to Shadebot's sleek style, while the retro console buttons serve as a reminder of its arcade origins. Don't let the laid-back vibe fool you, though; Retro Shadebot is a master of pixels and a guardian of old-school gaming culture in the WebtrES club."
