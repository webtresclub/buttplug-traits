  "Name": "Rocket Retro",
  "Description": "Rocket Retro is a high-flying member of the WebtrES club, known for his vibrant rossoCorsa box chassis that can be seen blazing across the digital sky. With arms and legs that transform into powerful rockets, he's always ready for action and adventure. His screen may be classic, displaying the charm of the '80s arcade era, but don't let that fool you; he's loaded with cutting-edge tech. The retroConsole buttons on his interface are a nod to a simpler time when all you needed was a joystick and a couple of buttons to dive into endless hours of gaming. But make no mistake, Rocket Retro is not just about nostalgia; he's a true connoisseur of the gaming world, an ambassador of the pixel, and a crusader for the best of digital entertainment."
