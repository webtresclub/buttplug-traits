  "Name": "Sgt. WhiskerByte",
  "Description": "Sgt. WhiskerByte was once the leading edge of feline-combat simulation technology, training soldiers with his uncanny reflexes and strategic prowess. His classic boxy exterior houses an advanced AI, programmed to think like a cat - unpredictable, agile, and cunning. The cat-themed buttons are a nod to his software's core, which is inspired by the instincts of a military-trained feline agent. Years of intense virtual training sessions took a toll on his screen, leaving it cracked but not defeated; it's a battle scar he wears with pride. Donning shades even in the face of adversity, Sgt. WhiskerByte now serves as a mentor to new recruits in the WebtrES club, sharing his wisdom and preparing them for the digital battlegrounds of the future."
