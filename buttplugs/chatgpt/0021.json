  "Name": "Commander PixelBrick",
  "Description": "Hailing from the digital realm of RetroConsole, Commander PixelBrick is a legendary figure among the WebtrES club. With a stoic red and black screen that can flash intimidating patterns to scare off intruders, he's known for his unyielding courage under fire. His helmet, a relic from the ancient 32-bit wars, is adorned with battle scars, each telling a story of a hard-fought victory. Despite his soldier button interface that suggests a strict military protocol, Commander PixelBrick is surprisingly down-to-earth, often seen with his arms relaxed at his side, a sign of his approachability. He's a hero to the pixelated and a true guardian of the arcade galaxies."
