  "Name": "Sgt. Sparkplug",
  "Description": "Sgt. Sparkplug is a battle-hardened member of the WebtrES club, known for his shiny yellow armor that has seen many skirmishes. His buttons bear the mark of a soldier, with each one representing a mission he's accomplished in the digital realm. His arms and legs are of the classic build, sturdy and reliable, a testament to his old-school training and combat style. The cracked screen he sports is not a sign of weakness but a badge of honor, showing that he's survived encounters that would have decommissioned lesser bots. Despite the damage, Sgt. Sparkplug continues to fight valiantly, leading his pixelated platoon through cyber battles and safeguarding the data frontiers."
