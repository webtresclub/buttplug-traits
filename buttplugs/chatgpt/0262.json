"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Sergeant PixelBeam\",\n  \"Description\": \"Sergeant PixelBeam is a legendary figure in the WebtrES club. Known for his classic box design, he hails from an era when things were simpler, but much harder. With buttons that resemble the attire of a seasoned soldier, he's always ready for action. Though his arms and legs are designed with a minimalist 'handDown' aesthetic, they are sturdy and reliable in any digital skirmish. His most striking feature, however, is the laser screen - a cutting-edge visual display capable of emitting concentrated beams of light to communicate in Morse code or to create stunning light shows that dazzle and intimidate his opponents. He's a loyal guardian of the WebtrES realm, always on the watch for cyber threats and ready to leap into action to protect his fellow club members.\"\n}\n```"
