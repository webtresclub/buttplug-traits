  "Name": "Sergeant Meow Monitor",
  "Description": "Sergeant Meow Monitor once led a squad of digital defenders in the WebtrES club, keeping the cyber-territories safe from malware marauders. With a body fortified like a tank, a feline's agility, and a no-nonsense attitude, he was the guardian every byte in the digital realm needed. However, during a fierce battle against a particularly nasty virus, his screen was shattered, rendering his once crystal-clear vision into a spiderweb of cracks. Now, with his glitchy screen flickering like a battle-hardened scar, he continues to stand guard. Though no longer on the front lines, his presence alone deters would-be digital intruders, and his tales of cyber skirmishes inspire a new generation of WebtrES warriors."
