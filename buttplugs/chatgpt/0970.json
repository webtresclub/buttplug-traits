  "Name": "PixelPurr",
  "Description": "Hailing from the vibrant corners of the WebtrES club, PixelPurr is a retro gaming console with a twist. Born in the golden era of 8-bit graphics, this quirky character has a screen that displays an ever-changing array of cat expressions, reflecting its sassy and unpredictable personality. Its classic buttons and joystick bring a nostalgic feel to anyone who encounters it, while the hands positioned ever so casually by its sides show a relaxed, yet ready-to-play attitude. PixelPurr spends its days reminiscing the glory of old-school gaming sessions and nights dreaming of the next big adventure on the pixelated horizon. Despite its vintage look, it has a knack for modern gaming trends and often surprises members of WebtrES club with its agile maneuvers in the latest indie game releases."
