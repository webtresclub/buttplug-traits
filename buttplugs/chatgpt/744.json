  "description": "Pixel is a quirky oscilloscope-themed robot who is a proud member of the WebtrES club. With a cat-like box body and retro console buttons, Pixel stands out with its unique personality. Its arms and legs hang down like a cat's paws, ready to explore the digital world. However, its screen is broken, giving it a distinctive glitchy appearance. To make up for this, Pixel wears stylish glasses, which add a touch of sophistication to its overall look.",
