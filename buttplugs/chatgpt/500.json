  "description": "Circuit Cat is an oscilloscope themed robot that is part of the WebtrES club. Its box-like body resembles that of a soldier, while its arms and legs take the form of sleek and agile cat limbs. The screen on its face, unfortunately, is broken, but the robot compensates for this with a cool pair of shades as an add-on. With its unique combination of soldier-like features and feline agility, Circuit Cat is a formidable member of the WebtrES club.",
