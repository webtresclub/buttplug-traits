  "Name": "PixelPatcher",
  "Description": "Once the pinnacle of arcade gaming, PixelPatcher is an NFT from the WebtrES club whose life took a turn when an unfortunate encounter with a rogue joystick left its screen with a distinctive crack. Known for its vibrant orange chassis and classic button configuration, PixelPatcher reminisces about the golden days of gaming. Its hands perpetually positioned downwards, this bot now spends its time in the digital realms, offering up nostalgic tales and patching up code in the background of new-age games. Despite its broken screen, PixelPatcher remains a beloved character, its glitches adding charm to its pixelated personality."
