"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Retro Sergeant BitCrash\",\n  \"Description\": \"Once a valiant pixel defender in the digital wars, Retro Sergeant BitCrash now spends his days reminiscing about the golden era of 8-bit gaming. His box is weathered from countless battles, and the broken screen is a testament to his resilience, having survived the great console crash. With arms and legs of classic design, he stands as a monument to the old-school gaming heroes. His retro console buttons hint at a time when gameplay was simpler, yet no less challenging. Donning glasses as a symbol of his wisdom, BitCrash is a mentor to the younger codes in the WebtrES club, often seen sharing war stories and teaching the art of pixel strategy.\"\n}\n```"
