  "Name": "PixelViper",
  "Description": "PixelViper is a quirky character from the WebtrES club known for its vibrant orange exterior and love for all things retro. With a screen forever playing the classic game 'Snake', PixelViper is a walking tribute to the golden era of arcade games. Its retro console buttons are not just for show; they are fully functional and PixelViper often challenges other members to high-score competitions. Despite its competitive nature, it's known for always lending a hand (down) to fellow club members in need of a power boost or just some good old-fashioned gaming advice. Its blocky, pixelated form is a hit at 8-bit theme parties, and it dreams of one day setting a new world record in the most snake games played simultaneously."
