  "Name": "Pixelton Forge",
  "Description": "Hailing from the pixelated planes of 8-Bitonia, Pixelton Forge was once a simple console in an arcade room, gleaming in shiny yellow and entertaining players with his retro console buttons. After a freak electrical storm, he gained sentience and foundry-like arms and legs, which he now uses to craft his own game worlds. His red and black screen often flickers with the creativity of a game designer intent on challenging the status quo of gaming. Pixelton is a cherished member of the WebtrES club, where he shares his unique perspective on the evolution of games and interactivity."
