  "Name": "PixelVision Paddy",
  "Description": "Once the centerpiece of a bustling arcade, PixelVision Paddy has seen his screen time fade with the rise of next-gen consoles. Sporting his classic button layout and retro console design, Paddy was the go-to machine for the most iconic games. After a mishap involving an overzealous gamer and a sticky joystick, his screen got cracked, but his heart remained whole. Adorned with a pair of glasses that he found in the lost and found, Paddy now spends his days reminiscing about pixelated glory and offering sage advice to all the gadgets in the WebtrES club, always ready to lend a helping hand or a sympathetic ear to those who are nostalgic for the good old days of gaming."
