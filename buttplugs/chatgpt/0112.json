  "Name": "Major Blaze",
  "Description": "Major Blaze was once a valiant defender in the pixelated world of WebtrES. Sporting an orange boxy frame indicative of his fiery spirit, his soldier buttons were a testament to his strategic combat skills. With arms and legs powered by rockets, he was known for his explosive entrances and swift exits. However, during the legendary battle of Code Canyon, his screen was shattered, leaving a spiderweb crack as a badge of honor. Despite this, Major Blaze's courage never wavered, as he continued to wear his helmet with pride. Today, he stands as a symbol of resilience and determination, inspiring new recruits in the WebtrES club with tales of his daring feats."
