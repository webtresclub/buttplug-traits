"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Sergeant Pixelburst\",\n  \"Description\": \"Once the most formidable digital defender on the pixelated plains, Sergeant Pixelburst was known for his unbreakable code of conduct and unwavering duty to protect his fellow WebtrES club members. Adorned with a bright orange casing, he stood as a beacon of courage, his soldier buttons always polished and ready for action. Unfortunately, during the great Cyber Skirmish of '22, a rogue data packet shattered his screen, leaving his display in a state of perpetual static chaos. Though he remains operational, his once clear vision is now a fragmented dance of pixels. Despite the setback, his hands are always down, ready to assist, and his spirit undeterred. Sergeant Pixelburst continues his watch, a testament to resilience in the face of adversity, inspiring all WebtrES who know his story.\"\n}\n```"
