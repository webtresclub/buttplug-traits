  "Name": "Feline Forge",
  "Description": "Once a mere piece of smart equipment in an abandoned cybernetics lab, Feline Forge gained self-awareness after a freak lightning storm. With arms and legs forged from the strongest metals, this bot escaped into the wilderness. Its forest green box, etched with the wear of time, camouflages it in the lush undergrowth, while its cat-button interface purrs with a mind of its own. The laser screen eyes, once used for high-precision crafting, now help it navigate the dark woods and spot resources from afar. Armed with a trustworthy axe in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, Feline Forge became a legend amongst the WebtrES club members as the protector of the forest's secrets and the master of survival."
