  "Name": "Spectro Byte",
  "Description": "Spectro Byte is a quirky little bot from the digitized city of Pixelton. With an orange casing that's as vibrant as a sunset, he's a standout member of the WebtrES club. He's been equipped with classic button controls, which give him a charmingly retro vibe that harks back to the golden era of arcade games. His arms and legs are of the traditional model, sturdy enough to let him bust a move when the 8-bit beats drop. Spectro's most noteworthy accessory is his thick-framed glasses, which aren't just for show; they're actually high-tech lenses that help him analyze and debug the toughest of codes. He\u2019s the go-to bot when any member of the WebtrES club runs into a computational conundrum, and he approaches every challenge with a calculated coolness that's both reassuring and inspiring."
