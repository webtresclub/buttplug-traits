  "Name": "Pixel Forge",
  "Description": "Born deep within the pixelated quarries of the Digital Mines, Pixel Forge is a unique member of the WebtrES club. With a forest green box chassis that blends seamlessly with the virtual woodlands, he is virtually unseen in his natural habitat. His retro console buttons are a nostalgic nod to the classic era of gaming, while his arms and legs, forged from the finest digital foundry, allow him to construct and deconstruct bits and bytes with precision. Pixel Forge's screen radiates a laser display that not only mesmerizes onlookers but also serves as a beacon in the darkest corners of the cyber realm. Don't let his blocky appearance fool you; Pixel Forge is a master craftsman in the digital world, capable of building or dismantling code with the swing of his hammer, all encoded with the ethos of the WebtrES club."
