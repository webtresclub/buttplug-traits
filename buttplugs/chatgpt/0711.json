  "Name": "Serpent Sprocket",
  "Description": "Serpent Sprocket was once a decorated hero in the mechanical armies of the WebtrES club. Donning his iconic camouflaged helmet, he was easily recognizable on the battlefield. His box and buttons were forged from the strongest soldier-class alloy, capable of withstanding severe impacts and digital warfare. The most remarkable feature of Serpent Sprocket was his arms and legs, which were replaced with state-of-the-art rocket propulsion systems, giving him the ability to maneuver across treacherous terrains with explosive speed and agility. His tactical prowess was unmatched, especially with his screen displaying the strategic patterns of a snake, symbolizing his cunning and unpredictable combat techniques. Despite his martial appearance, Sprocket harbors a deep sense of camaraderie and honor, always at the forefront of the fight to protect his fellow club members. His tales of valor are still whirred among the circuits and wires of WebtrES, inspiring new generations of digital defenders."
