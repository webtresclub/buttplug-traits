Originally a top-tier arcade console, he gained sentience through a mysterious power surge during a thunderstorm. With his soldier button interface, he can execute commands with military precision. His feline arms and legs give him the agility of a cat, allowing for swift movements and reflexes. The screen of his face, always displaying an enigmatic cat expression, conceals a sharp mind capable of outsmarting his foes. His coolest accessory, the shades, not only shields his eyes from the glaring sun of his homeland but also adds an air of enigma to his character. Commander Whiskerbyte spends his downtime strategizing over classic games and perfecting his tactics for the next big adventure with his fellow WebtrES allies.\"\n}\n```"
