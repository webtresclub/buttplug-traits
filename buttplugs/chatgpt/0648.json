"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"PurrCade Pixelwhisker\",\n  \"Description\": \"PurrCade Pixelwhisker is an animated character from the digital realm of WebtrES club. With an eye-catching orange box body and a retro console interface full of nostalgic buttons, PurrCade is a throwback to the golden era of arcade games. However, this quirky character's uniqueness doesn't stop there. PurrCade boasts a set of sleek, cat-like arms and legs, giving it a peculiar yet charming agility and stealth. But life hasn't always been easy for PurrCade; its screen suffered a crack during an intense gaming session when it tried to master the most challenging level of 'Pixel Pounce Adventure.' Despite the broken screen, which now displays a permanent glitch-art spider, PurrCade remains an upbeat and fun-loving member of the club, always ready to jump into action and bring joy with a side of retro flair.\"\n}\n```"
