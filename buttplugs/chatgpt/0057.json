"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Serpent Sentry\",\n  \"Description\": \"Hailing from the digital foundries of WebtrES club, Serpent Sentry stands guard at the virtual crossroads of cyberspace. With an orange box chassis that glows like molten metal and buttons bearing the mark of a soldier, this pixelated protector is always at the ready. Its arms and legs, forged in the pixel flames of the foundry, carry the strength of a thousand code compilations. The screen, alive with the essence of a digital snake, represents the agility and awareness required to keep the club safe from any virtual threat. Serpent Sentry may not speak much, but when it does, its words hiss with the wisdom of the ancients, a guardian not just of the club, but of the secrets it holds within.\"\n}\n```"
