"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Captain Blaze Comet\",\n  \"Description\": \"Hailing from the neon-lit raceways of Cyberville, Captain Blaze Comet is known for his rocket-powered maneuvers and the iconic rossoCorsa chassis that gleams under the starlight. With a classic button configuration that pays homage to the arcade legends, and a screen that displays his pixelated expressions, Blaze is both a nostalgic nod and a futuristic vision. His helmet is not just for show; it's a relic from the Omega Racing League, a testament to the countless light-speed laps he's endured. Blaze's story is one of a daredevil turned hero, racing against time to save the WebtrES club from the notorious pixel pirates of the Ethervoid.\"\n}\n```"
