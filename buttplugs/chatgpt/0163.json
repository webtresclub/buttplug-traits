  "Name": "Cataclysm Console",
  "Description": "Forged in the era of 8-bit glory, Cataclysm Console was once the centerpiece of every gaming den. With a box designed to mimic the retro consoles of old, this quirky character quickly became the life of every party. Its buttons feature the playful essence of a cat, as do the arms and legs that give it a peculiar charm. However, one fateful day, a high-score challenge went terribly wrong, leaving its screen with a web-like crack. Despite its broken screen, which now displays a curious spider-like pattern, Cataclysm Console's spirit remains unshattered. It roams the WebtrES club with tales of pixelated adventures and the golden age of gaming, adding a sense of nostalgia and resilience to the group."
