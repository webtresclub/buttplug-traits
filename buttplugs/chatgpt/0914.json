  "Name": "SerpentByte",
  "Description": "SerpentByte is a veteran member of the WebtrES club, known for his strategic thinking and old-school charm. Born from the pixels of a bygone era, he proudly wears his camouflage pattern, a tribute to the classic arcade wars he used to fight. His retro console buttons evoke a sense of nostalgia amongst the club members, reminding them of the simpler times when all you needed to save the digital world was quick reflexes and a pocketful of quarters. With his classic arms and legs, SerpentByte stands firmly in the present while his screen frequently displays the 'Snake' game, a testament to his ability to adapt and survive through countless cycles of technological evolution. Despite his rugged exterior, SerpentByte has a heart of gold, always ready to lend a hand (or limb) to his fellow WebtrES comrades."
