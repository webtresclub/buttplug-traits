"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Sergeant PixelBlast\",\n  \"Description\": \"Once the most decorated officer in the 8-Bit Battalion, Sergeant PixelBlast now cruises the digital skies of the WebtrES club. With a broken screen faceplate that's seen one too many digital skirmishes, he wears his cracks like badges of honor. His arms and legs, upgraded to rocket thrusters, enable him to soar above the cyber battleground, executing tactical maneuvers with precision. A retro gaming console for a heart, his buttons still remember the glory days of arcade dominance. Donning a battle-worn helmet, this soldier has been reprogrammed for peace, but when the call to action beeps, Sergeant PixelBlast is ready to launch into action, leaving a trail of 8-bit nostalgia in his wake.\"\n}\n```"
