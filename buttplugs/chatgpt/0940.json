  "Name": "Catoscreen Whiskerbyte",
  "Description": "Hailing from the pixelated alleyways of the WebtrES club, Catoscreen Whiskerbyte is a unique blend of feline agility and retro technology. With an orange boxy exterior and the heart of a cat, Whiskerbyte once displayed happy images to the world before an unfortunate encounter with a digital mouse led to a broken screen. Now sporting a pair of chic glasses to hide the cracks, Whiskerbyte paws its way through the cyberstreets, charming netizens with its quirky buttons and cat-like limbs. Despite the glitch in its display, this character remains a beloved figure, offering a glimpse into a world where the lines between organic and digital life charmingly blur."
