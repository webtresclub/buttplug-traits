"```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Sergio Screenbuster\",\n  \"Description\": \"Sergio Screenbuster was once the leading entertainment system in the barracks of WebtrES club, showcasing the most epic battles and training simulations. His sturdy orange case and soldier-grade buttons were the envy of every tech gadget around. However, during an intense virtual skirmish, a digital grenade went awry and caused his screen to crack, leaving a spiderweb pattern that now adorns his display. Despite his injury, Sergio's spirit remains unbroken. He continues to serve the club members by providing strategic insights and pixelated humor, all while proudly wearing his battle scar. Some say his broken screen allows him to intercept and decrypt enemy transmissions, though Sergio just winks with his remaining pixel whenever asked about it.\"\n}\n```"
