  "Name": "Professor Purrange",
  "Description": "Hailing from the pixelated alleyways of the WebtrES metropolis, Professor Purrange is a quirky and inquisitive character, known for his unparalleled coding skills and a peculiar penchant for fish-flavored data packets. With his bright orange casing, classic button configuration, and sleek cat-like limbs, he is often seen leaping from one digital rooftop to another, troubleshooting problems with the agility and grace of a feline. Donning a pair of thick-rimmed glasses, he exudes an air of intellect and mystery, analyzing complex algorithms with his sharp, glowing screen-eyes. Despite his somewhat robotic exterior, Purrange has a warm, byte-sized heart, and is always ready to lend a helpful paw to his fellow WebtrES club members."
