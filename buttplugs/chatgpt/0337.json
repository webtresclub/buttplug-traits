  "Name": "Cleofus the Retro Coder",
  "Description": "Cleofus is an enigmatic character hailing from the digital alleyways of WebtrES club. His shiny black casing shimmers like a starless night sky, while his retro console buttons hint at a nostalgia for a time when pixels were the height of visual technology. Despite his rather serious appearance, Cleofus's limbs tell a different tale; they are sprightly, cat-like appendages that allow him to deftly navigate the complex web of cyberspace. His screen, adorned with a serpentine pattern, slithers with a hypnotic grace, a nod to his ability to charm and outwit any antivirus software he encounters. Sporting round glasses, Cleofus is not just a lover of bygone games but also a whiz at writing sleek algorithms. With his blend of old-school charm and new-age smarts, Cleofus spends his time coding up a storm and reminiscing about the golden age of arcade games, all while staying one step ahead of the digital curve."
